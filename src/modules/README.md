NOTE: the shape of the modules was chosen deliberately to not have an `index.ts` or any sort of utility method such as `createModule(...)`. This is because the various files get injected at different stages during game load and shouldn't be bundled together - therefore we keep the `data.ts` and `control.ts` and the other files separated and manually import each into their respective `src/data.ts` and other top level registries. This way we can also granuraly control if, some some reason, we need different import order of different things
