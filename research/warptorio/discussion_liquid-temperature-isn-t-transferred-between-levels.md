**Ruby_Schnee_nee_Rose (op):** When one transfers liquids, the temperature changes to 15 Celsius, rather then staying at their proper temperatures, it seems. I was attempting to put my power system in the lower levels, with boilers on first basement and engines on second basement but the engines weren't working due to the temperature, it seems.

**NONOCE (mod author):** Oh, I thought temperatures weren't used in the game anymore. I added some logic for steam to transfert at the correct temperature now.
