**IIIStrife (op):** What is it for and how do I use it?

**IIIStrife (op):** Also, the Right Harvest Platform is misaligned or it seems to be. I've noticed them having some problems when you first get them, but once you restart the save or the game, the problem seems to fix itself. By misaligned I mean the rightmost column of platform tiles just doesn't want to work for creating the platform, so when you place it, the teleporter is half a tile to the right instead of being fully on it.

One problem is the left platform doesn't spawn with a loader when you have the upgraded warp belts already.

**PyroFire:** This mod is the original warptorio, which appears to have been abandoned by NONOCE who hasn't been heard from for 3+ months.
