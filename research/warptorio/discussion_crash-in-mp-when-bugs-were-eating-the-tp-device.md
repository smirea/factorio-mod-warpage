**LordKTor (op):** Hi great mod.

Had a crash in MP while biters were attacking the deployed TP device that was receiving oil.

**PyroFire:** Yeah... Not surprised. The lua is quite bad. I'm working on a new version of this mod which should fix a lot of bugs, including this one. Thanks for the report though :)
