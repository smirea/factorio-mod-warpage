**tandronicus (op):** We upgraded one of the warp upgrades (one of the platform ones I think?) and now our steel chests (between floors) have turned into logistic chests, which has sent our bots into a manic spiral of death where instead of doing their job they're trying to move thousands and thousands of anything and everything into boxes instead of going down or up a level. Is there a way to fix this? The only way we can think of is to eliminate bot use...
