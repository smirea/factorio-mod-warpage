**Cwhizard (op):** Specifically its crashing at on\_player\_create or something, which should be on\_character\_create. Simple fix and its in the patch notes,

**NONOCE (mod author):** The mod has been made compatible with Factorio version > 0.17.34. So it should not crash in this way anymore.

**Cwhizard (op):** Thanks for the fix, it is working great now. Currently running a game with everything bob+angels plus warptorio. It is challenging, getting a mining op set up before the 2 minute mark so I can mine enough before the 5 minute mark to make it worth the time tearing ti down in an emergency and having ti small enough that I can tear ti down quickly. Plus the water situation lets me skip 2-3 worlds before i have to refill.
