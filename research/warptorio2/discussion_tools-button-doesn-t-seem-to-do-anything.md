**mnvoronin (op):** After researching the warp toolbelt, there is an extra button at the top left of the screen, but it doesn't seem to do anything. And there are no other updates in the UI, so I'm not sure how to "recall harvesters and teleporters remotely".

Help?

**PyroFire (mod author):** Tools button appears to be working in latest version, make sure your mods are up to date.

**Dentisto:** +1. Doesn't work for me either. Everything updated. Love the mod.

**PoppuTheWeak:** From what I can gather, the "recall harvester" buttons give you back the left/right platform item to build the platform but leaves a deployed platform, using the platform item doesn't do anything if the platform is already deployed.
For the planet teleporter, using the button puts it back in your inventory, "building" it displays "only one allowed - built", removes the deployed teleporter, and builds the one you wanted.

Not sure if this is the intended behaviour...
