**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** this mod is flawless.

Except for...
- Pollution on homeworld needs special handling.
- Circuits should stay connected when teleporters are upgraded
- Factorissimo inserters bug <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2/discussion/5d4c969c3fac7d000d283949>
- Desync issues on warping and harvesters (?)
- Warp Pipes are don't follow loader direction settings (?)
- AFK Players in multiplayer causing issues with votewarping.
- Harvester combinators lose connections to other (same-side) circuitry when place/recall <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/6081bb92449c38110e20446e>
- Some pipes do not maintain orientation or fluid contents during some cloning events <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5f32b5e820429995452a4452>
- There are no researches/technologies for linked chests: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5fc90935c3f5b165591bc388>
- Prevent players placing tiles over warp concrete: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5fd50228285f67ccffe1aed9>
- [Mod Compatability] MiniLoader cloning issues: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/601ef0c021aae5bce96ccdcd>
- [Mod Compatability] Fix NewGamePlus: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5f4572f3225d6f290cedb099>
- Placing a Harvester on top of hazard tiles, particularly logistics hazard tiles, will permanently pick-up a clone of the platform entity when you research platform upgrades that spawn the hazard-reserved-entity after placing the harvester. <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/636e33c830eb43710ed68e92>
- Both Warp Armor and Warp Strider cannot be crafted in an assembler because Power Armor cannot be stacked in them, but they still show up as a recipe in the assembler: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/65be54a5471129b55edaf0cd> <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/65a92733087062876500b4ed>

Planetorio has several bugs which have been reported with warptorio:
- Missing template crash. Workaround is tick RNG forward from most recent save to get a different template from planet rng <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/62261ca6b671a97f4663da68>
- Modded ores <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5f0b612619f8b38c3eeb0dfd>
- Cliff propogation. Likely issues propagating other nauvis settings. <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5eadd0fdabee0e000d90a637>

The warp rails not aligned to platform is not a bug or flaw because the platform is aligned to 1x1 but the rails are aligned to 2x2. There is no intention of changing this, except for adding new platform layouts beyond the classic layout.

Note with AAI Vehicles <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-programmable-vehicles> there are cloning issues, use at your own risk. Possible workarounds have been discussed and attempted at length but no solutions were found. You are welcome to try your hand at it.

Stuff that aren't really flaws but are worth investigating:
- Add some achievements??
- Regular accumulators should be disabled to prevent confusion, or behave like cheap warp accumulators?
- Nauvis surface handling (It is like a secondary homeworld and can be treated as such)
- MP option for first-placed teleporter/harvester gets priority instead of being relocated
- Balance management of abilities
- Biter Waves should occasionally target the teleporter gate and harvesters.
