**porcupine (op):** Just curious, has anyone found an actual use for the castle turrets (on the surface, not the extra level space they provide underground)?

I tried to figure out how a layout of defence could work within their footprint (without yet having laser turrets), but couldn't see any obvious way you'd get more then a few turrets per platform simply hanging off the edge super exposed, assuming you intended to belt feed ammunition from the base. Thoughts/observations/etc?

**PyroFire (mod author):** "Castle Turrets" is a name.

Not a description.

I'm not sure I understand your response. Presumably you named the platforms castle turrets as some level of suggestion, no?

What's the *intended* use, if not for defensive structures? They're on the outer edges (at least at this point in my factory), so they obviously need to be defended...

**porcupine (op):** I wasn't tring to nit-pick/grope for sarcasm, was just trying to figure out the intended use (for the surface bit, if any), since I didn't seem to be doin' it right, that's all :).

---
**porcupine (op):** PS - I hadn't realized with my original post that the turrets/surface elements got bigger with upgrades. After the first upgrade, the surface elements make a *lot* more sense :).

**PyroFire (mod author):** It is intended that players come up with uses for the tools presented, including the turrets.
I've found their best use early game is just making it a lot easier to collect resources - you don't have to belt all the way to the center of the platform.

I.e the "harvesters" are actually just a deployable platform that turned out to be a very cool and fun feature.
Miners is an obvious use, but there may also be other uses and I like to see what they might be.
