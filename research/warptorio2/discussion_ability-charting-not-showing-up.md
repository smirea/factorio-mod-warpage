**Erikthefactory (op):** i have unlocked the ability to scan the area, but there is no button or anything where i can run that ability, all my other abilities are just fine, am i doing something wrong? the stabilizer, recalling harvesters, little electric explosion etc. are all working fine and i can activate them. where is the activate button for the radar?

**PyroFire (mod author):** Fixed as part of next update.
