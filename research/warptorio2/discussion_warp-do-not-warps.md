**hedinant (op):** Warp i snot moving me anywhere in a new game. Same map with same biters.
Not playable at all like this.

**misiu.pysiu:** I have the exact same thing. Sometimes it waprs once on a new map but then warps stop working.

Hug a biter, you'll be teleported to the main platform.

* Void tiles are not placed after the platform warps if a player is left behind. <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5ec90c50be5352000b91e857>
