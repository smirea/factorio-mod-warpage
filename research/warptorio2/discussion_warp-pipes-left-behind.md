**Spy_The_Engineer (op):** I have that mod that lets you nudge buildings, and it works on the warp pipes, but i did not realize they did not reset their position when the factory warps, so most of my turret outposts are missing at least on of the pipes each, maybe add a debug button that individually resets the pipes back to their original position in the factory? If not, ill just work around it haha, thats what i get for being reckless with irreplaceable stuff!

**PyroFire (mod author):** This is issue is half shared with the nudge-buildings mod.
I need some way to tell nudge-buildings which entities you should not be able to nudge, such as reserved platform entities, meanwhile in base factorio there is no reasonable way to mark which entities are which for their mod.
I added similar remotes to my own mod regarding cloning but that is a very grey area, however in the case of a mod that lets you change the position of buildings there is no greyness: A good solution to this is deserved, but unfortunately it is up to nudge-buildings to come up with it.
I'm happy to add any necessary mod remotes to make the mods work together.

You may be benefit making a post on nudge-buildings regarding this.
