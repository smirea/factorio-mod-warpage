**argbla:** Rumor is Warptorio 3 will be included in the new Valve Orange Box with Half-Life 3. It'll be worth the wait!

**PyroFire (mod author):** We're working on it.
Consider it the equivalent of a factorio2 compatibility update.
Might even have the void planet update in it ;)

---
**cbusillo:** I found Warptorio after Factorio 2.0 came out. I love Warptorio, but miss so many 2.0 features. I can’t wait if you are releasing an update that is compatible!

I started trying to migrate the code, but got overwhelmed after a couple of hours. I think when I hit the lack of inserter pollution, I quit and cried.

it is great news) do you have any time points when you issue update or share some info about it?

**behroozzx (op):** any news ???

**behroozzx (op):** any update ???

**cbusillo:** Just in case anyone is interested, Warp Drive Machine is based on Warptorio and is 2.0 and Space Age compatible. I am playing in now and really enjoying it. If Warptorio is updated to 2.0, I will do another play through of it. Both mods are awesome.

---
**metaphorious:** I'm currently trying to migrate to Factorio 2.0. Already got everything loading into a new game. Having some rendering issues and warping items between chests.
I'm wondering if I should continue and file a PR on GitHub or wait for you to publish Warptorio 3 or maybe I could help out somewhere?
