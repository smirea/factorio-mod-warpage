**protocol_1903 (op):** Is it possible to rebuild Warptorio to take advantage of linked belts, pipes, and cross-surface electrical networks? This would be nice to see what kind of power is being used without having to go to your lower floors.

**PyroFire (mod author):** I would put this in the same basket as not having any technologies to unlock recipes for the linked chests/belts which exist in vanilla factorio (kind of like the loaders - they exist but there's no recipe)
