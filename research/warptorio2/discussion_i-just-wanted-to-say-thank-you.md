**Xasch (op):** Hello PyroFire,
I must have spent over 500 hours with the mod Warptorio2 and now that you have adapted the mod so that it is compatible with mods that bring additional ores in the game, I think there will be another 500 hours in the future.
So thank you for this great mod! Without it, Factorio would be half as nice for me. :-)
