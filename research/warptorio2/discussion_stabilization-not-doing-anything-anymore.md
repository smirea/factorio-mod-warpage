**Zaanzabar (op):** Is it just me, or does the warp stabilization not do anything anymore?

It used to basically Delete your pollution. This made it possible to actually stay on a world as long as you wanted. now, it seems to do absolutely nothing. I keep hitting it, it keeps turning back off. what exactly is it supposed to be doing now?

**PyroFire (mod author):** Stabilization halts pollution.

Periodically removing some chunks of all their pollution would be a nice addition and make it more useful.
