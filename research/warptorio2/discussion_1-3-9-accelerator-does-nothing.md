**xoft (op):** Pressing the "Accelerater" [sic] button starts eating up energy, but otherwise seems to do nothing. I've checked the code and the globals.abilities.accelerating variable doesn't seem to be used for any calculation.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Confirmed issue. I wonder when it stopped working. I'll see what I can do for the next update.
