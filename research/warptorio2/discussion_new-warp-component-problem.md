**Dahel1989 (op):** Hi PuroFire,

Firstly, your mods is really awsome and brings a mode of play that is really fun and different from the other !! REALLY good job ! :D

Secondly, here's the bug/problem i keep having :
1) Everytime a new component is researched (harvesting, warp, etc), if there is an item on the specific spot that it spawn, the game either delete the item that was blocking it or crashes the game (the crashing part is the worst !)
2) also, sometime your floor separation for the new component is not AS BIG as the space it will take (wich doesn't help the problem 1)
- for now i have to always save before a new component add up to make sure to modify my factory so nothing bad happens.

* Here's 2 solution/proposition i think could help with that :
  1) make the floor separation the right sizes for the new components to make sur not to build on them (or at least see what to clear)
  2) Put a description somewhere that says where the component will be and/or it's size ? Or i think a picture of it's placement could help... i dunno

Well that was the only problem i found yet.
I was pleasently surprised to see it working smoothly even when i have a LOT of mods in the game with it (even other game changing ones like krastorio2)
I still have a lot to discovers on my playthrought with your new expansion witch ads missions for the components (HARDDD !!! but so fun and challenging on deathworld mode x\_O !)

Thanks a lot.
TB

**PyroFire (mod author):** Re Problems:

1. it is intended that space be cleared. crashes happen when that doesn't happen correctly (intended).
2. sounds like hazard tile inaccuracy. this is known.

Re Solutions:
1. If it were that simple it would already be done.
2. where should the picture go? (this is actually the biggest problem). Second is there's no reasonable way to display that. A description isn't always helpful, maybe I can mention which floor the item appears on where relevant, but i recall having already done that. I'll check it at some point.

Thanks for feedback and your kind words <3

**blahfasel2000:** Just as an idea, instead of instantly applying the upgrade upon finishing the research you could add a button to the already existing UI to apply unlocked upgrades. Optionally you could provide some preview on what entities will get deleted. My first thought for the "preview" was to mark them for deconstruction. This isn't ideal as if there are construction bots they will immediately start dismantling stuff, but it's preferrable over let's say losing a warehouse containing most of your iron stockpile, plus it still gives the player the option to cancel the deconstruction for the moment and wait with the upgrade until things are relocated.
