**Genij (op):** When Playing on a save in multiplayer with a friend we end up without biters, but when we start the same save and warp in single player, then there are biters on the next planet.
We noticed that issue pretty late into the game, as I was already playing it in single player for multiple hours and was checking it out in single player every now and then.
