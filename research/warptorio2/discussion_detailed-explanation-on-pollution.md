**norathem (op):** Hi,

just started your mod, and so far I'm really liking it. However I don't really get how pollution works, especially the pollution that seems to be generated by the platform. I read the part in the FAQ but still got some question, so I'm hoping someone can help me with more details.

Is the platform generating a fixed amount of pollution?

The FAQ talks about a multiplayer on pollution by the platform. Does this only affect stuff produced in the platform? I have a little setup in the first level (only got the stairs so far) that have like 5 assemblers and the labs. I produced some Iron with burner miners for like 15 min with very small attacks. Then I build a steam engine, hooked it to the platform and got overrun in like a minute.

Does the pollution produced by the platform increase with bigger size / more levels? So maybe its wise not to upgrade it if you don't need the space?

**PyroFire (mod author):** The platform generates a "fixed" amount of pollution irrespective of size and researches, where this "fixed" amount increases exponentially over time no matter what you do. Multiplayer has little to no effect on this. It is wiser to always upgrade whenever you can reach it, there is no penalty.
