**ValeFact (op):** Hello, not sure if omnimatter is supposed to be compatible with warptorio but on some warps the omnimatter mineral doesn't generate at all (no other minerals either). (explored 20 warpzones with the command that reveals the map with 1000 radius)

So far omni generates on:
the first map
planet that you wonder if it has a name

no minerals or omnimatter on:
planets that remind you of home
there is water all around you and seems to go on forever
the usual critters and riches surround you but something is missing

tested with only omnimatter and warptorio mods

**PyroFire (mod author):** Compatibility with omnimatter is dubious at best, though it should still spawn on the majority of planets so this is bug

**Xon1:** A related bug; <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/planetorio/discussion/637b9292963feacd858ce67b>

Non-standard resources appear to default to nothing without explicit worldgen settings for them on the non-homeworld surface. But I was having trouble debugging further.
