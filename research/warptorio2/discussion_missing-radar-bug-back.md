**Incus (op):** So I booted up today and started up my save. The radar is now gone from my crafting recipes.

**PyroFire (mod author):** This is the first time an issue like this has been reported.
And you are the only one whom has reported it.

It is likely there is no issue with warptorio here, instead, you've probably got other mods installed which are breaking it.
Disable all mods except warptorio and planetorio then you should find your radars are working fine.
