Basically, please don't clone/re-upload my mods with 2 changes or less.
If you're interested to expand on one of my mods, feel free to do so under the condition that you do something unique or flavorful with it that undoubtedly distinguishes your version of the mod from the original.
So to speak, please take your version of the mod in a different direction.

Multiple mods with the same premise, overlapping features and identical gameplay just make both mods less enjoyable and less accessible. So please be original <3

Example; forking warptorio with a different layout for the platforms and without any other changes, or forking spaceblock to put its recipes in a special assembler and without any other changes, these would be inappropriate.

An example of this done appropriately is how the mod Mobile Factory is forked from Harvestorio, but has taken a very different direction for its features.

Otherwise "standard" open-license rules apply - accreditation to the original author (myself) and a link to the original work.

If you're unsure, you can contact me on discord. <https://discord.gg/a9CNarA>

That is all.
Thankyou for your cooperation, happy developing!
