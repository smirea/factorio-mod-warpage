**Akhunrah (op):** First off, I've been absolutely loving this mod, been playing it off and on for several months now. Thanks for the excellent overhaul.

I just built my first Warp Strider. After much anticipation and diverting all my resources towards, I was so excited to plop it on the ground aaaaannnd... it's tiny. Like, 1/3 the size of a Spidertron. I'll get used to it, but I was hoping it'd be at least the same size as a Spidertron. I like the feeling of towering over my factory, and now I feel like I'm just walking between them again. Can we get a bigger version?

**PyroFire (mod author):** Working as intended, but I like your thinking.

A 0.5x but 10x speed spidertron was the original intention, but I could make a 10x size and 0.5x speed one too....
