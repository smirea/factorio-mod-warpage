**snopey1 (op):** I researched lvl 4 West mining platform with it being placed on an iron node near the south west turret, upon it's expansion I noticed it consumed some of the SW turret. I got a chuckle but didn't think anything of it.

after warp see photo 2 for how it looks.

No idea how to fix it, but didn't see any other bug reports for this issue. No auto saves that go far enough back either :shrug:

since it doesn't load into the chest for the SW turret that loader is useless.
Researching lvl 2 SW turret did not update loader/pipe locations
Loaded last auto save to get 4th screen shot.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Very interesting.
It is intended you able to place harvester on top of platform, but putting it on top of the hazard tiles is simply unheard-of and I would have never anticipated it. I suspect it will self-correct when you next upgrade your logistics or harvester, one of the two, but either way this is an interesting problem that needs an explicit solution. added to list of flaws <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/5d878e4456d5f6000b291475>.
