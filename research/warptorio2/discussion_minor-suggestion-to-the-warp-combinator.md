**Myzumi1337 (op):** Heya,

Just having a minor Suggestion to the Warptorio Combinator to have the current Evolution on the planet included as a signal if possible and maybe aswell the frequency of the "natives"?
Would be useful to have sometimes in some circuit constructions, so would love to see it!
