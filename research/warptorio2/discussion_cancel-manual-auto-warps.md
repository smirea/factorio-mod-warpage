**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** Suggestion to add the option to cancel warps after the warp button is clicked.

Maybe if the manual warp is cancelled, that it restarts the autowarp timer on a shorter time, even if you have researched to where the autowarp is disabled?

Special thanks to @Evan on the Warptorio discord for the suggestion.
