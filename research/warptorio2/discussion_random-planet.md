**pro5 (op):** I can save the game 10 seconds before warp, I can kill random enemies and change the next planet. Thus, you can choose any planet.
It might be worth making a separate random number generator that is not affected by anything other than the warp event.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Working as intended.
