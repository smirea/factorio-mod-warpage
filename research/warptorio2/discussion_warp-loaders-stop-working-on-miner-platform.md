**Dentisto (op):** Warp loaders stop working, when used on the warp miner platform and placing the platform on an ore patch.
The buildable warp loaders. In the end game with high enough mining productivity, the 3 normal ones arent powerfull enough.

**yngndrw:** I have the same issue. Pressing R to change the direction fixes them, but you have to do it each time. I also generally found the warp loaders to be a bit slow, they don't seem to produce a nice packed belt.

**shiunsay:** +1

**PyroFire (mod author):** Warp loaders on the harvesters is an unhandled situation, it is unfortunate, but I am also not surprised this is happening.
The kind of rigours the warp platform can subject the warp loaders to is very likely to lead to problems.

Issue requires further investigation.
