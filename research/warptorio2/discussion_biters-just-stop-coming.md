**Puppy (op):** I've been playing a second playthrough of Warptorio and encountered an odd thing; biters just.. stop. The warp reactor still emits pollution; I've barely made green so safe to say it wasn't me doing anything too weird. But the biters just don't attack. See <https://imgur.com/a/zq1Qzpc> - the spawners are absorbing pollution but nothing happens.

I noticed odd gaps in the biter timing before where they just stopped attacking. But after this they came back with a vengeance so I decided it was just them gathering an extra big attack wave. After that though, they never came back. I spent the last 13 minutes of the zone (about 30-16) on the surface right next to the warp platform alone with no attacks. Finally after about 17 minutes in the current warp zone, and emitting a load of absorbed pollution, I've killed my first biter.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Do you have any other mods installed other than warptorio and planetorio?

**Puppy (op):** I had quite a few, but it's no worries, I carried on with the playthrough and don't have a save or anything available anymore, so probably nothing to be done about it. I now realise that the biter attacks are a lot more random than I thought so maybe I just got lucky.
