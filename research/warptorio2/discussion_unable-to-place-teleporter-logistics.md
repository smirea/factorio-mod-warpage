**vicarious (op):** I have this message keep popping up, maybe once every few hours. Not associated with any action like warping or placing harvester. I don't know what the message is supposed to mean or how to resolve it. Does not seem to be causing issues though, still able to play mod.

"Unable to place teleporter logistics, something is in the way! - inner check"

**PyroFire (mod author):** \*update
This is normal behavior, no issue here.
I have replaced the print with a sound and flying text.
