**coolguy445 (op):** HI! im having a problem with the mod where no matter my settings i can't get a single bitter to spawn and attack me. Peaceful mode isn't on and even with the highest settings (having a 1 in 10 chance for a wave to spawn) nothing spawns, does anyone have any clue what may be causing this?

**PyroFire (mod author):** you probably have a mod conflict.
