**Ferlonas (op):** The direction that pipes on the factory and harvester floors are facing is reset on each warp for me. (Warp Platform Logistics 2)

**PyroFire (mod author):** this is still an issue.
Also they apparently lose their contained fluids.

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** added to list of flaws, noting loss of fluid contents issue in addition to orientation
