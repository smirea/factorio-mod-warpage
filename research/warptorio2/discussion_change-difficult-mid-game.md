**Wacky444 (op):** Can the difficult be changed on a save? I have changed the mod settings to increase the peace time between warps and reduced the exponential growth of the pollution,

Does it affect the current game or so I have to create another save?

**Wacky444 (op):** I managed to change the setting of the mod in a save by playing it in single player then saving and hosting it.

**PyroFire (mod author):** The mod difficulty settings should be available at all times.
Most of them you can change mid-game without issue.

If there are issues related to changing mod settings on a multiplayer server, this may actually be an issue for wube.

**Ziron999:** New game+ mod makes it kind of rougelike too if you are into that.
