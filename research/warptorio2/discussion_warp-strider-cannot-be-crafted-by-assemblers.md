**hjoyn (op):** Warp striders require 8 power armor mk2's to craft, but those do not stack inside assemblers. As a result, assemblers cannot craft warp striders. If being unable to automate crafting warp striders is to be made intended behavior, the recipe should not be allowed in assemblers at all to reduce confusion.
