**ichvii (op):** The energy bar below the Radar/Stabilizer/Accelerator abilities has the wrong units. It uses GW for electric energy storage instead of GJ and "MW/sec" for energy production/consumption (or power) instead of MW. This really bugs whenever I look at it.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Hah.
Nice catch, noted.

It's about as 1nd as bad as this one.
