**Beefy_Swain (op):** As per the Discord...

> there is currently no way to cancel a warp when it has been started. adding a manual-warp-halt is an interesting request, first of its kind too. for something like this it would be far better to open a thread on the mod discussion page so it can be better tracked

**PyroFire (mod author):** Working mostly as intended.
I think there should be a lock-in to warping, but also I agree there may be some given time to consider a cancel-warp as a feature.
Maybe a mid-to-late-game technology along the warp reactor tech path?
Food for thought.
