**Chiedubeurre (op):** I have researched my first harvester platform, and playing around with it (placing / removing it to understand how it worked in regard to the structures placed on it), I managed to make the loader disappear. It effectively made the whole platform useless.
Is there a command I can use to restore it? Warping did not solve the problem.

**PyroFire (mod author):** This should auto-correct when deploy/recall.
I doubt this will still be an issue after 1.3.6

**ltab:** My harvesters just lost their loaders as well, though after researching the upgrade to express loaders. Removing/replacing them doesn't restore the loaders, nor did warping to the next world.

Edit: Warping with the harvesters placed and then placing them on the next planet seems to have fixed it.

This is still an issue after 1.3.6. It happened to me.
