**TSP (op):** Hello, we are playing together in a weekend event with Warptorio2 and we came across a critical bug. Some people were accidentally left on the initial world (so, before any warps) while the people on the platform when it warped, warped to two different planets at the same time. 4 of us on a desert planet and 3 of us on a different one...

The second image showing the admins trying to get people to go to the same platform/world. And after that warp we were all together on the same one. We hope it won't occur again.

Edit: I misunderstood, they were on the first world after all while some of us teleported to the second world. The people that stayed behind still had their platform for some reason. The important part was that some of them actually were on the platform when the warp occurred, so they still stayed behind for some reason.

**PyroFire (mod author):** So warp boundary misalignment and (known) no void tiles after warp.
You had me worried for a minute there.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Void tiles (finally) fixed in 1.3.6
