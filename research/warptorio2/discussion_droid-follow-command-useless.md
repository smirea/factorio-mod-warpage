**ghastendee (op):** Hello,

i love the mod! But i must say, the Droid follow command CTRL+E is does almost nothing when there are enemies on the screen. The droid believes he can attack (maybe with a very weak attack) and prioritizes that over my "follow" command. This leads to that planets with a higher mob density i have to literally spam CTRL+E hundreds of times to make it follow me, because any enemy that comes even remotely on screen will trigger the "attack" of the Droid. Very frustrating, and the CTRL+E should have priority over the weak attack of the droid. I'm at warpzone 173 so i've seen it quite a bit now.

Thx!
