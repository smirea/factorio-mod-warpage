**VforVandetta_ (op):** So me and my friend wanted to play warptorio2 and have seen warptorio3 was more recent but after experiencing a bug at north harvester platform where loader was facing the wrong way so we looked at the mod again and has seen the description in information tab which warptorio3 adds is north and south harvester platform so we now want to get our save/factory to warptorio2 how do we do that? (we have played like 8 hours)
