**Keldrenon (op):** Hi.

I have a not so fun problem with the miniloaders from Therax. (made already a bug report)

After a warp the miniloader simply stop to unload from every container. From Wood Chest to Steel. And since i use Angel Addons: Storage Option here as well.

Now it seams that this occurrs only on the sureface and not in the other rooms.
I turned all other Mod i use off and either it broke the game or it occurrs on every warp.

Best Regards Keldrenon

**Keldrenon (op):** As addition: I also use RP Warfare, Combat Mechanic Overhaul. Shield Generators and Shield Projectors. After a Warp the Shield Generators must recharge and the Shield Projectors do not workon the sureface. But on the other floors they work.

So ...... maybee...... the new map makes the Miniloader and the shields go nuts?
