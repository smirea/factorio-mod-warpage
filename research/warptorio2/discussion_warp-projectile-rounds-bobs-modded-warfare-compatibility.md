**casscadier (op):** First Thank you so very much for making such a great mod!

as the title suggests Warp Projectile Rounds doesnt apply to the different turret types that Bobs expanded warfare adds (tho it does for bullets and shotgun shells because they are attached to the original one similar to AP rounds) I'm pretty sure this is an issue more of how Bobs expanded warfare adds in the additional turrets then a warptorio issue, but I thought I would bring it up anyway.

Thank you again for your time :)!
