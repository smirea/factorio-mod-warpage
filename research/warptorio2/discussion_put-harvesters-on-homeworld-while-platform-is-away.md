**mward (op):** If I use a "Warp Homeworld Portal" to warp to my home world, leaving the Warp Platform on another world, and try to place down the Planet Teleporter Mobile Gate, it just disappears and cannot be found anywhere.

The Harvester Platforms can be placed, but are completely blank with nothing on them (not even the loaders).

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** The gates and harvesters can only be deployed on the same planet as the platform at current.

**mward (op):** I can understand why gates and harvesters can only be deployed on the same planet as the platform. They teleport back to the platform when the platform warps and the player gets left behind, so perhaps they should also teleport back to the platform when the player uses a warp homeworld portal? Then it would not be possible to try and deploy them on another world, and the problem would not occur.
