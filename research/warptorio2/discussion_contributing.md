**PoppuTheWeak (op):** Hello!

Thanks for this great mod!

Is there any way to contribute to it? Be it code, translations, things like that?

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** Of course. You can put these in threads or join the discord: <https://discord.gg/a9CNarA>

**PoppuTheWeak (op):** The github repo hasn't been updated in years, where can I get the latest source?

My current plans include:
- fixing the "platform teleporter" item's icon, which covers totally assembly/chest pictures
- probably start a French translation => never mind, <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PatchFR> does it already

Then I'll see, depending on what you fix/do too :)

**PyroFire (mod author):** The latest source is always available by clicking the download button and unzipping the zip file it gives you.
Same goes for downloading through factorio.
All factorio mods are open source, you just need to unzip them.

As stated, if you would like to contribute you may open new discussion threads or join the discord.
It takes a lot of work maintaining mods so if you would like to help please get in touch and let's work together!
