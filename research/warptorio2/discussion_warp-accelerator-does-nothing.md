**wvlad (op):** It literally does absolutely nothing but only drains energy.
Also the Stabilizer seems to have a very weak effect on pollution if any at all.

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** accelerator makes the warp timer countdown faster.
It's purpose is rather niche for the biter planets.

Stabilizer is ~7% platform pollution (your factory still pollutes). I've dropped it to 2% for next update

---
**Ferlonas:** I've charged the accelerator to 9%, and neither the warp charge nor the warp timer were dropping noticeably. Is there something else to do except click on the button?

---
**wvlad (op):** Yep, that what I was talking about

---
**Zaanzabar:** Is there any way to get it back to the old behavior? At this point, pollution drops the my power meter so fast, that it takes about 5 seconds to run out of juice. Then it takes 5 seconds to recharge, and I have to hit the button again. Every 10 seconds..... How do I up the power Intake/reserves/potency? I can't figure how the current energy is being generated.
