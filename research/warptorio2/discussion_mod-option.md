**Ziron999 (op):** Change platform size? I don't know much about the mod but I'm going assume there is a max size that is very limited right? Maybe options to change how big it can be?

**PyroFire (mod author):** This is wishful thinking. there are ongoing plans to make custom platform layouts a thing, but changing those sizes with mod settings for each platform layout is quite the dream. Unlikely to happen.
