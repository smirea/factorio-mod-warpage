**J3asti (op):** I am missing a way tp automate a Warp. You can read if an warp is already active but u cant write it. Or its just in the endgame.
It would be nice to automate the warp with some circuit automation in the early/mid game.

**PyroFire (mod author):** I confirm there is currently no way to automate warping to the next planet via circuits.
Working as intended.
It would probably be nice, true, but... how exactly again would that be executed by the player again??
