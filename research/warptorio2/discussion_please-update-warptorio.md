**minci (op):** Can you please update warptorio for factorio 2 and perhaps for space age? It is really a very intuitive and fun mod changing the game, its pace and how you play it. I am planning to start and finish it again soon.
I would like to see (if I may):
- Better descriptions for platform functions. I never understood some buttons and actions.
- Perhaps you can see other platforms or previously destroyed platforms during your journey.
- You may add Space age and other planets into warptorio which would blow things to 5th gear.
- Platform may have special powers you can upgrade: electric shock attackers. Stop pollution for an upgradeable duration. Repel creatures for a duration. Teleport some random materials from another dimension into a box.
- Add another level or make the production level a bit bigger.
- Location of pipes and belts between levels can become changeable. At least you can select them to be near the north/south wall instead of in the middle.

**minci (op):** You can activate the said special abilities by accumulating huge amount of electricity and using it in one go + upgrade from technology.
