**wvlad (op):** When placed above ground their loaders are removed on save/load.

**CaptainSlide:** Can confirm this happens to me too.

Also breaks the relationship with mini-loaders mod (have to reverse the direction twice to reactivate), also noticed that the requester chests on the stairs lose their requests sometimes and circuit wires to the central stairs also disconnect some times too, not consistently though.

**Der_Failer:** Same here with the loaders and mini-loaders, in addition i found that the mining depots from mining drones break when teleported.
