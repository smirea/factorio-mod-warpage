-Loader Redux / mini-loader
-Squeak Though

**CaptainSlide:** I'll add some too

Belt Boxes Mod - really allows you to up the through put of those middle stair loaders.
Warehousing Mod - essential for stock piling stuff for rest planets or low resource planets
The Ruins Mod - Kinda cheaty but gives access to a whole range of stuff that you wouldn't be making for a while, also gives a good reason to explore.
Jet Pack Mod - Particularly useful for the Expansion to complete those missions quickly
Tiny Start Mod - Start game light armor with roboports and 20 construction bots, very useful for those 20min warp windows.
Fill 4 Me Mod - puts ammo in turrets, coal in burners etc. Really handy for turret creep
Omega Drill Mod - much quicker mine building and mining, great on low level harvester platforms as they over hang a long way and give good patch cover.
