**Jazo (op):** Since 0.18 I and other players always spawn at the Platform at loading a Game.
Didn´t saw it in the changelog, or the freatures.

Can I disable it?

**PyroFire (mod author):** What? Where did you expect to spawn?

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** Is this still an issue?

**Jazo (op):** Hi, sry I was away for a few days.
I save at Position X but always get teleportet to the Base after Loading.
It has something to to with the Multiplayer. Only over Multiplayer hosted Saves will have this issue for me.
When Loaded as Singleplayer it works normal.

I think it has to a Warptorio Issue, because other Mods dont know where the Platform is and after Researching the first Machine Area I will get Teleported there instead.

**PyroFire (mod author):** This happens because if a player disconnects then rejoins later, they would be left behind on a previous planet.
The teleport to platform avoids this problem.
