**enrico.bof (op):** Hi.
Thank You for your effort in this nice mod.
I would to point you about what i think is a bug.
If i put down some bricks or concrete tiles on the warp floor, them disappear after the warp.
Same behaviour on the harvester pad floor.
Is this intended or is a bug? Could you please check it?
WALLs work like i aspect.
thank You

**PyroFire (mod author):** it's an unintended feature! :D

No but for reals i'm not going to fix this.
Warp concrete gives the best speed bonus anyway.

Thank You anyway.

**PyroFire (mod author):** I have added this to the list of flaws for completeness.
Players should not be able to place tiles over the warp concrete.
Main issue is there is no solution for the hazard concrete, and there is a limited number of tile slots available.
But I can add the restriction for the basic concrete which should be enough to stop people attempting it, and the replacement to expected tile would still happen.
