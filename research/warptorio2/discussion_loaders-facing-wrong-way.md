**VforVandetta_ (op):** loaders exit side faces towards the chest it spawns with rather than looking away from it <https://imgur.com/a/Tu0so2A> only had power poles there idk how to fix it

**VforVandetta_ (op):** ok i got it download waterfill mod and place 1 water below each loader loaders will disappear but you get the hazard concrete back fill water holes with landfill then hazard concrete and you can place 2 loaders in there which works fine but you can remove them anytime
