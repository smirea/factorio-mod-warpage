**lauajalg1 (op):** Any way to remove the icons? Poked around in the settings but cant find it

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** added for 1.3.11

**Sphendrana:** Since the other, more recent thread asking this question was locked, I'll ask here since you gave the same vague response both times basically.

Where is this setting located/what is it called? I just want to find it and disable it myself as well, but I've gone through the mod settings five times just now and still don't see the option.

**PoppuTheWeak:** PyroFire mentions 1.3.11, but the latest published version is 1.3.10, so it's probably not yet released/available...
