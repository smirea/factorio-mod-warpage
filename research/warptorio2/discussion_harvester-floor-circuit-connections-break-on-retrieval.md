**Baughn (op):** The two 'constant combinators' on the harvester floor, although they reconnect to each other when the harvesters are retrieved, also break all other circuit connections at the same time.

This makes them useless for automation, since I'd need to manually rebuild the connections every time we retrieve the platforms.
