**Hitchhiker (op):** Hi, had a really good time playing your mod.

1) Warp Platform Logistics 4 changes the chests to provider/requester chests. PLEASE make these passive provider chests, not active. I can not use storage chests, they will be pumped full... And the description says it upgrades the belt speed, they are already blue on #3.

2) Warptorio Toolbar lets me recall the teleporter gate, but not the harvesters remotely.

**Trig90:** 1) You can change it in the mod settings.

**PyroFire (mod author):** There are many good reasons in favor of making the logistics chests active providers against passive providers. For this reason, this is a mod setting you can change at will and update your loaders at-will by rotating them. You can even interweave them and have a mix of passive providers and active providers. As to how that reduces your time to first rocket launch, that's a challenge I haven't seen yet ;p

For 2; working as intended. The expansion may give you a harvester-recall button, but in the sense, there is a need to distinguish between 'give me the harvester placeable' against 'recall the harvester and give me its placeable' and the difference is non-trivial, similar to trying to decide between active vs passive provider chests for platform logistics.
In the general case it is my opinion that Active Provider Chests are the most optimal by-default option, but I also agree that it ought to still be an option and up for debate, so yeah. If you can prove one case or the other, I encourage you to try. But short of that, hey there's a bunch of other mod settings available while you're checking out the logistics chests mod-options, so by all means check them out, particularly the CareBear chest particularly if you're struggling in the early-game! :D

**Hitchhiker (op):** Thanks!

**PyroFire (mod author):** The default logistic chest has been changed to passive provider by popular demand for the next version 1.3.11.
