**123mind123 (op):** I am not sure if this is a setting issue or a bug with the mod or something but on the second jump within 1 minute of landing endless swarms begin spawning in rapid succession. I have tried a few times but with 5 swarms spawning (of about 10-20 biters each) every 30 seconds, then having those swarms double in size every minute or 2. I am really not sure what to do. In the mid or late game I would get it but at this point I haven't even had a chance to access green science and the swarms end up being so large all my iron ends up just going into ammo before they inevitably eat everything. I try warping but the swarms just spawn as soon as I arrive in the next section. Making it impossible to set up mines or production of any kind.

I have been playing for a long time and while I am certainly not the best player I am good enough to beat a death world. So unless this mod is only built for speedrunners I feel like there must be another kind of issue.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Appears to be working as intended.
Brutal difficulty is only difficulty.

It would take a fair lot for this to be considered as a genuine issue.
Such as accurate timings as to how long between landing on a planet and when the first attack happens, as well as accurate measurements of how many biters appear and at what timings.

Warptorio2 was deliberately made difficult.
Maybe try ticking the Carebear difficulty option in the Mod Settings?
It is dangerous to go it alone.
