**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** --- Mods that are already planets

<https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IceOre>
<https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FrozenWorld> -- this has custom noise functions, and the map\_gen\_settings useful for alien biomes

---
**Ferlonas:** <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AbandonedRuins> works well with Warptorio in my opinion. Perhaps a ruin planet from time to time would be interesting

---
**Virid:** <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ctg> - there is a way to disable starting resources near spawn?

Please refer to the FAQ <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/faq> and the Warptorio Planet Pack <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio_planet_pack/faq>

This thread is purely for linking noteable mods that can be turned into planets.
Please start a new discussion if you have further questions about planets or how to make them in general, or anything relating to map generation settings. Mods posted here may be used as examples in your discussion.

**Mylon:** How about [Omnimatter](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/omnimatter)?

---
**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** I've had a look at that, and it can't reliably be turned into a planet.
That mod is also why the required\_controls is needed on planets.

---
**Mugiwaxar:** Playing with Warptorio2 and omnimatter together since now 40h+
Work fine :)
Just even more complicated

---
**Mylon:** @Mugiwaxar,
I meant as a planet. Though it would be silly to build a huge omni processing chain and do all of that research if you only need it 10% of the time.

---
**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** But what would an omnimatter planet be like? The rich, dwarf, or rest planets? Those already exist, hence why i say it can't really be turned into a planet.

---
**Mylon:** Not exactly a mod, but one planet idea could be Deja Vu. Pollution and/or evolution starts elevated! For extra deviousness, the surface can be flagged on first visited so it won't be deleted and re-used on a later jump.

---
**Mylon:** I updated Global warming for 0.17, if you're still interested in making that into a planet.

---
**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AbandonedPlanet/discussion>
this seems similar to the abandoned ruins mod posted earlier

<https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Mazing> another maze planet

---
**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** another abandoned factory mod <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ZAdventure>

---
**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BlackMap>

---
**mrudat:** A Junk planet? a combination of [All Minable](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AllMinable) and [Production Scrap 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ProductionScrap2)

Or, perhaps: [Leighzer's Scrapyards](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/leighzerscrapyards)
