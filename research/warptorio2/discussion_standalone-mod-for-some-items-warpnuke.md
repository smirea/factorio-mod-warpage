**NightWolf_89 (op):** Can you / Someone make a standalone mod for the warp nuke with a simplified recipe? (maybe also a lighter version with the explosive rocket)
I really enjoyed a nuke that can't attack friendly forces.
I tried to understand the mod files / code to make it myself, but I have no experience in programming and after almost 3 hours of not being able to understand a single thing I gave up :(
