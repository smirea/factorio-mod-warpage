**Deedasmi (op):** Occasionally I land on one of the blank planets with no biters or resources, but I'm not in a spot where I want to/need to reorganize. Is it worth just chilling for the auto warp to let the tiles/water absorb what pollution they will?

**splee:** That sounds like a decision you have to make as a player.

I don't think any pollution is carried from one world to the next, nor does the platform have any finite limit to it's exhaust. So I dunno if pausing for island absorption really achieves anything if you're not also researching / reorganising / filling your mall. You still get to the next place and the platform pollution is still just coming out.
