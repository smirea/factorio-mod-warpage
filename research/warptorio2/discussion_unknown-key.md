**n_slash_a (op):** Loving the mod so far. Warp Reactor Re-Assembly Project 6, in the tool tip in the technology menu, where it should say the effect (next to the target icon) it says: Unknown key: "tooltip-category.shot". Minor bug, but wanted to pass it along.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Odd, I'm not sure where that is coming from, but I've added a locale string for this anyway for 1.3.11
