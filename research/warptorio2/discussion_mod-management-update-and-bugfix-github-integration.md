**PyroFire (op) (mod author):** Hi Everyone!
I have made many mods for factorio and I am confident in my abilities where you can utter words like "Coronatorio: Factorio but you must socially distance" and it is only a matter of time for me to turn that into a reality: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/coronatorio>
Using this ability, I have decided to explore game development as a full time career.
In a nutshell, I have started on a project which I intend to eventually be released on Steam as a fully fledged original game.
I have been keeping a dev log of this project on the warptorio discord: <https://discord.gg/a9CNarA>
"Life has its way with all of us".

I do not want to see my major projects being abandoned, however I also do not have the time and energy to do it all on my own.
Warptorio is more or less in its final state with all the necessary features implemented into the engine(s) that drive all the back-end magic.
What remains is polish, bug-fixes, and if luck would have it, more content like new platform layouts.

As a result of all this, I have decided to consider it a bug that Github is not set up correctly to help me manage this mod with the support of community input, and this thread is a "bug" report which may also offer information to players and mod-makers alike regarding how this mod will be maintained moving forwards and in the longer term.

Warping you all the best!
Pyro-Fire.
