**Der_Failer (op):** I added "Dark Tech Replicators" to an existing save and expected the world gen to add the new ore to newly generated chunks and to new world after warping, this however don't seem to be the case. I checked three words and couldn't find any (i used console commands to reveal large areas). I tried the same without Warptorio and it work fine.
I checked the map gen settings via /editor and found that the new resources where deactivated and even after activation the world gen didn't cooperate.

Edit: I looked in to a possible connection with another mod (doesn't seem to be related) and found that only the warpzones seem to be bugged, when i added the mod still on nauvis the resources spawned in new chunks.
