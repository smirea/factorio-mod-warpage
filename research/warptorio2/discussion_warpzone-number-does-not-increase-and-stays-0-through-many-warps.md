**DestinyAtlantis (op):** For some reason, the warp zone does not increase each warp, it still says "Warpzone: 0" even after many warps. Probably not gamebreaking (i hope), but still.

**Supaplex.:** When generate, and start new game in linux headless serwer - i have this same problem.
To resolve this problem for me i start game in windows factorio, save, and start this save on headless server.
