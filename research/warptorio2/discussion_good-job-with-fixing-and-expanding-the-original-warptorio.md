**NONOCE (op):** I'm the author of the original Warptorio. My initial idea was to create a simple gameplay spin on the base game to change the dynamic of it. Though through the development I discovered it needed more features for a factory to expand on a platform in a balanced way, and this was getting out of scope for me so I just abandoned this project. I'm surprised the idea gathered enough interest to be expanded on and be played by other people so good job Pyrofire with this !
