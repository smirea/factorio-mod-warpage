**enrico.bof (op):** Hi PyroFire.
Thank You for all the effort you put on this mod.

I'm playing WARPTORIO2 with "pump anywhere" mod.
I notice that water pump placed on planet platform are not cloned during the warp to other planet.
Could You please check this?
Best Regards
Enrico

A new information.
On underground levels (factory, boiler, etc...) the water pump (with PUMP ANYWHERE mod installed) can be placed and is cloned correctly.
