**SpoonWasAlreadyTaken (op):** What are you supposed to do when you Upgrade to Warp Platform Logistics 4. It completely ruined everything, now the entire Logistics network is just overworked and breaks anything so it just has to be removed. And you can't change the Active Provider chests to anything else, only by rotating but then you can't transfer resources between the platforms. So what do are you supposed to do in that situation.

**xhed:** You can change the chest type in the mod settings.

**PyroFire (mod author):** I have changed the active provider default to passive provider by popular demand for 1.3.11
