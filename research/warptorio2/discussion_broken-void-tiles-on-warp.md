**mogiaro (op):** I tried to move to another planet but i messed the launch base. So righfully, my character is not teleported.

But after i press the warp button and does not work anymore, even if i am on the base launch. Why?

**PyroFire (mod author):** you got left behind. the blank platform is supposed to be a void.
You can't warp unless you're on the same surface as the platform.

**mogiaro (op):** The concept is ok, but a bit too aggressive. Anyway the mod seems good.

**PyroFire (mod author):** missing void tiles added to list of flaws
