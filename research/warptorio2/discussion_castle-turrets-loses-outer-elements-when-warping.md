**shiunsay (op):** First of all, thanks for the awesome mod, i'm having a blast playing it. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into this Pyro!

My castle turrets are missing a few items after warping, coincidently all my walls, but after some testing i can confirm any item placed around the 2 outer tiles will be gone.

I don't know if this issue happens on all levels of the castle turrets, i've started protecting them only after researching everyhing.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Anything placed on the purple tiles should be warped along with the platform.
If this is not the case for you, then you are the first to report this issue in a long time.
Can you please confirm if this is still an issue for you and please inform what mods you are using?
Warptorio2 is known to work reliably without any 3rd party mods, so it is most likely you are seeing a mod conflict.
