## Gameplay:

Build your base on a platform that follows you from planets to planets and escape biters before they overwhelm you.  
This mod is intended as a way to change the building dynamic, as you will have to develop your base around a platform.  
It keeps the pressure on you too, as you will also have to choose between staying to extract more resources and evacuating before the biters break your defence.

---

## "Lore":

The warp reactor is your failed experiment. It seems better at attracting biters than generating energy, it's unstable and will destroy the planet it's on if left unmanaged.  
Fortunatly, as an unintended consequence, it can pull itself and it's surroundings into an interdimentional rift and lead you to a safer place.  
So escape biters, try to build a rocket and get away !

Warptorio2 is canon to Starshiptorio: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/starshiptorio> happening many years prior to the events in that mod.

---

## Usage:

A button is added at the upper-left of the screen to allow you to warp out when the bitters get too strong for your defense, but the more you warp, the more it will takes time to charge.

Time is short on each warp, but this warp reactor technology allows some new upgrades to help you out.

## Warptorio1 Update

Hi, i liked the original concept of this mod but i didn't like how buggy and broken and unfinished it was, so instead of waiting for the original developer i just did it myself in like 2 weeks.  
Enjoy.

Special thanks to Nonoce for originally creating this fantastic mod - <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio>

### New Features

- Balanced and added a bunch of vanilla researches: mining productivity, character mining speed, character reach, worker robot speed and capacity, inventory capacity, inserter capacity.
- Fixed a bunch of essential bugs: Multiplayer issues, power supply issues between platform floors, platform logistics pipes connecting with eachother, entity ghosts changing directions between warps and removed unwanted features: energy costs of using teleporters
- Addressed a bunch of essential gameplay mechanics problems: Made loaders direction determine chest transfer direction, added logistics chests upgrades to loader chests for use with robots late-game which helps to bypass belt throughput limits, significantly increased the maximum number of belts between floors, made platform pipes uni-directional, added circuit connections between floors, and tweaked the behaviour of teleporters to be more predictable and less disorientating.
- Overhaul: More than doubled the maximum size of the planet floor, factory floor and boiler floors, and gave each floor a unique shape.
- Overhaul: Science has been completely reworked with an entire chain for each floor and a whole bunch of other new researches, like for adding water to the boiler floor. Science now extends to space science including a warp bomb weapon, warp armor, warp modules, and a set of additional giant rooms for each platform floor.
- Overhaul: Re-worked stabilizer and accelerator into ability buttons with a shared cooldown, and slightly re-worked and tweaked the warp charge timer.
- Overhaul: Warp Reactor has been reworked with a progressive research chain, a lore storyline, and is now uniquely interactive with craftable super fuel and a special craftable & placeable entity.
- New Feature: Planets. You now warp to planets with different attributes, such as iron-rich or a random resource is missing. Each planet has a unique description, hinting at the type of planet you land on. New loot chests will randomly spawn throughout every planet with random goodies in them, encouraging some minor exploration of each planet.
- New Feature: Warp Rails. You can unlock special platform rails that can withdraw/deposit the contents of an entire cargo wagon at once, opening up some interesting gameplay around the use of trains.

## Mod Compatability Information

This mod is compatible with most other mods on the mod portal.

Soft Conflicts may exist for a few mods, which are conflicts that don't necessarily crash the game but may result in unintended or buggy behavior.

- AAI Vehicles: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-programmable-vehicles> - There are cloning related issues with vehicles on the surface
- Attach Note: <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/attach-notes/discussion/5d90a80e4cfd8a000c824d4e> - There are issues related to entities in blueprints. You can disable the warptorio blueprint manager in the settings to avoid this conflict.
