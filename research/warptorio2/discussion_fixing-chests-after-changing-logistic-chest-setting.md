**anyoneeb (op):** I recently unlocked the level of platform logistics that gives the logistic chests and was surprised they were active and not passive provider chests. I found this thread <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/warptorio2/discussion/622fc5a2f4fae9ab7a46da0e> explaining the reasoning and pointing out the setting, so I changed the setting... but I don't know how to get it to apply to the existing chests (other than the platform teleporter). Is there some script command I need to run?

EDIT: Figured it out: the chests get changed when swapping the loader direction with [R], so just had to run around to all of the loaders and swap their direction twice.
