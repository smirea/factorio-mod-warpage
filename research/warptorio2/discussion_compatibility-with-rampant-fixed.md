**RedWizard (op):** I just noticed that Rampant is listed as incompatible with this mod, and I've had Rampant, Fixed installed. So far I haven't had any issues and am wondering what the conflict with Rampant is and if it exists with RF?

**Normal69:** For me it ran into this when Warp Platform Logistics 1 was researched:

I hope that helps?

With deactivated Rampant fixed, used /cheat all and it worked.
When Rampand fixed was activated, after cheating all research, the game hung with the above error message.

Incompatible.

**RedWizard (op):** Huh. I got all the way to endgame without running into any issues.

Good to hear! I wasn't so lucky - it might have been another mod in my collection.
Now I have to halving search on all the old ones from Kras Ghoulash too. :(
Going over that research exits my current or new games with the pastebin error above.
Bad, because I've got curious of this mod - now I'll search for all the information. :D

**PyroFire (mod author):** I've removed rampant from incompatibility list.
