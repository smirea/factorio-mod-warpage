**Kadet123 (op):** Firstly, enjoying the mod so far, good work.

But one thing that's stalled the whole base several times are platform stair upgrades. On the chests that teleport items between floors, I have circuit wires that signal between floors what items are present and/or needed. Each time there's an upgrade to that tech, the chests lose their circuit wires, which leads to unwanted things happening (like all iron flooding from one floor to another).

It's not a major issue, but it is mildly frustrating.

**Kadet123 (op):** Also, in a similar vein, nothing about the "Warp Platform Logistics 4" research says its going to magically change all the platform chests into active provider chests and wreak havok with bot logistics. That needs a better description. Especially since it functions different than its 3 prior versions.

**PyroFire (mod author):** Hello thank you for your feedback and i'm glad you've enjoyed the mod.

Todo: Make clear the logistics upgrade research descriptions that changes standard chests to logistics chests, and review circuit connections between upgrades.
