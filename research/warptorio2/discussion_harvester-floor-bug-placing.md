**Darkenlord1 (op):** There is a possibility to place base floor via placing one harvester on area of another.

**PyroFire (mod author):** I would expect this to self-correct on warps.
Also a very minor issue: When your harvester has buildings on it, you will be unable to place one harvester over the buildings of the other.
