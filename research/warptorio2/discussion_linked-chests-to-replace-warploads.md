**billbo99 (op):** Link chests have been added to the game, maybe these could replace or help warp loaders.

Two or more chests can have the same link ID. Anything can be put in / taken out of the chests, they reference the same inventory.

**PyroFire (mod author):** what was broken warranting such a change?

**billbo99 (op):** When we were playing Warptorio2 last month on our community server we had an issue with the Warp Loaders not following the filters set on the loaders. We also had a server crash with the "LuaTransportLine".

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** warp loaders don't work that way. They distribute resources based on the loader filter. It's not like a chest.

---
**PyroFire (mod author):** I have added "technology for linked chests" to the list of flaws, as the warptorio mod should have techs to enable these for the player.
