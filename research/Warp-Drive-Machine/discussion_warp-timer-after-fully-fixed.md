**Sir_AL (op):** When you research "spaceship fully fixed" it removes the ability to speed up and slow down the warp timer/leave time. However it does not set the warp charging timer to 0. So you have to wait out the timer with no way to speed it up anymore. Not the end of the world or anything though.

**Sir_AL (op):** Also when stabilize ability is lost you lose the ability to stabilize on the space station to help buy more things.
