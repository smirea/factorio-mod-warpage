**Draugo (op):** Is condenser supposed to have some different values. It's hard to get anything with 4 levels of condenser. I'm currently gettin 50/s which is nothing and the multiplier is stuck at 1 no matter what I do. Even with multiplier of 10 it hardly seems worth it since you can't use multiple pipes to get more water. Am I missing something completely. Based on the code it's hard to tell what the value is on average but since it's heavily based on 0-1 range and the planet water level is multiplied with the tech level then values much higher than 50 seem to be extremely rare.

**che6ur3k:** same to me. seems like totally useless tech with such values. i think it should be something like 75\*2^tech-level effectively replacing a single offshore pump on last level

**crowmang:** I agree, the condenser and the resource sucker are incredibly useless techs. It's part of the reason why the tedium feels so unrewarding: the lack of tangible upgrades.
