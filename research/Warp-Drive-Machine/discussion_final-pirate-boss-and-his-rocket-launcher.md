**beak3r (op):** Nice modpack. Not sure if this was intended but the final pirate boss was equipped with rocket launchers - and toxic biter spawners are immune to this. Had a good chuckle while I was able to gun down the final pirate's 900k hitpoints with a fair amount of ease as he stood there trying to rocket the crap out of the toxic biter spawner. Regardless - the final spaceship was not an easy fight. Absolutely enjoyed this modpack man. took approx100 hours solo.
