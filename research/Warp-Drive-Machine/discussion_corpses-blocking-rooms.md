**Sir_AL (op):** It seems that if biter corpses are on the edge of the platform when you leave to space, the corpse can block the placement of rooms on that side. I'm not 100% sure of this because I haven't had more then one event of adding a room while corpses were there. But nothing else seemed to be placed beyond the edge to block it.
