**denspb (op):** First of all, thanks for a great mod, I've really enjoyed playing it!

Here are a few bits that I've found a bit confusing during the play, and some suggestions (will post as other topics):

Sometimes buttons in UI are disabled and it is not very clear (without looking in the code) what is the reason. It probably makes sense to add some tooltip that would explain reason why button is disabled. Most confusing part was the "Home world" button (where home world can only be world later than #25).

A bit less (but still confusing) was the state of the button to "Prove the ancient rune knowledge", I understand that it gets unlocked as a part of natural progression, but having some idea when exactly it would get unlocked would be helpful.

Also, one of frustrating bits was the dependency of one ship repair unlocks on the uranium processing, that is itself locked on actually mining a bit of uranium, that becomes unavailable for some time. This might be an overlook in 2.0 changes, maybe the ship repair should depend on uranium mining (not processing)?
