**denspb (op):** When travelling to Gleba there were two things that felt strange, compared to vanilla SA:

* Removal of heating tower technology. It felt a bit wrong, requiring some inconvenient options (boilers with separate electric network/radars) to get rid of byproducts, and also makes power generation less convenient (due to loss of bonus). Judging by code, that is an intentional change, but I don't quite understand what part of balance does it target.
* Not sure if intentional or overlook, but the "production pollution" generated by ship floors seems to get converted to the "spores pollution" that gets spread around the base. On the one hand this is in line with "increased difficuilty" of the mod, but on the other hand that skews the Gleba overall balance a bit too much.

**MFerrari (mod author):** So heating tower is used on gleba now to get rid of spoliage ? I didnt know that.. I have only used that on aquilo...
