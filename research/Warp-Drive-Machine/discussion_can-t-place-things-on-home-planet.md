**Sir_AL (op):** After we set our home planet we weren't able to place anything differently on the planet then otherwise. Everything warp drive related is researched before space science. Can't place concrete, refined concrete, green space ship tiles, blue spaceship tiles, Rocket Silo, assemblers, or any other building normally not allowed. (Beside cargo landing pad, can place that.) The save isn't using space age mods. It is using rooms.
