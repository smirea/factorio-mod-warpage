**orthostice (op):** I think I'm simply blind to it. I didn't see any patch note changes regarding it. I'm on WDM 1.0.9

My H floor's main square is 29x29 tiles. I don't see any research that specifically mentions it.

I have main warp drive upgrade 3 and expand spaceship floor 2.

Dosh's play through has at least 32 tiles wide, hard to count tiles where he doesn't have buildings placed.

expand spaceship floor 3 in my game, requires yellow and purple science, which I don't think he has at this point in the video.

Ty in adv for any responses <3

**TechieNeko:** The Research is called 'Spaceship Storage Room', Its the Ship with an Infinity Chest Icon
Took me a while to find it myself yesterday xD

**orthostice (op):** Thank you! I could have sworn I searched for "storage" but I guess not!
