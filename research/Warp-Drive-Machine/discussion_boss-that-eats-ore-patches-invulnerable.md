**EntityCrethus (op):** Hey there, loving the mod!
Is it intentional that the bosses that eat ores (I've seen a few different types), the ones that roam around and consume entire patches of ore in seconds, supposed to be invulnerable?

To be clear, they can be damaged by things like grenades, shotguns, etc. but turrets won't shoot them, personal lasers won't target them, submachine gun can't target them, etc.

It's kind of painful going through 12+ warps to find a single piece of iron, only to have it eaten by a boss you can't even kill. :)

**MFerrari (mod author):** Hahah. Yeah.. damm ore eaters... Hate and love then. They are neutral force, until You damage 10% of their HP.. then they became enemy and your turrets willl shoot
