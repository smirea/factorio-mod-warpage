**Sir_AL (op):** Not sure if it is a bug, incompatibility, or just my combo of mods. But when using auto module inserter mods I've noticed a few things. When using them on a building on the green "any" tile they work fine but if anywhere else they only remove modules that don't match. (Other tile types and open world miners/pumpjacks.) However my mining-patch-planner mod still inserts modules fine. I've included a list of the mods in my save along with their versions. I've tried an alternative for some of the related mods with no obvious change in behavior.
