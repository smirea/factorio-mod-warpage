**fairyqueen (op):** This is a ship, not a base. Why is the upgraded silhouette all square and prototype, why not design a more suitable shape for the ship? (Triangle, spindle, oval) There are also square and round ships, but I prefer my base to be like a ship. Although square and circle can also be put into the shape of a spaceship, but the length is limited, and the space is wasted.

It is suggested that there are several optional upgrade ranges, such as rectangular triangles, etc., as the compensation length of the shape can be longer in line with the shape of the spaceship.

Finally, I hope to have an engine that can move the whole base within the same map, this is a ship not a jump platform, I think it should be able to move within the map
