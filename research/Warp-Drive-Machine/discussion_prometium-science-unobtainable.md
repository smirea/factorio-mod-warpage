**WindowShane (op):** Is there a way to get promethium science? I'm at the very end of the game and it appears to be unobtainable. There is no science to unlock it in the tech tree and the final few sciences are locked behind it, mainly the Spaceship Fixed and Pirate Space Probe

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** try this command, until I make the fix
/c game.player.force.technologies["promethium-science-pack"].enabled=true

---
**WindowShane (op):** Is there a way to get promethium chunks or should I just wait for a fix?

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** There is a Quest for promethium. The only fix required is to unlock the technology with the command above

---
**WindowShane (op):** Awesome, thanks! And thanks for the work on the mod!

---
**WindowShane (op):** Also, how do you break the promethium chunk once you find it? I feel like I've tried everything but nothing happens. Is the mining rig supposed to be aligned with it?

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** Wait, isnt It aligned ? Share your saved game please

No, it was a bit above it. I'm not sure if I initially placed it down in the right spot but I tried making a new miner in the circle and it auto built where the last one was. So I'm guessing it did the same when I first made it

**MFerrari (mod author):** thanks for the save. please update. problem fixed

---
**WindowShane (op):** You're welcome! And thank you for the quick fixes!
