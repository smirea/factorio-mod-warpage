**atsuren21 (op):** Hello

Could anyone describe how should I build ship by using rooms? The problem is - I bought several rooms from space shop between planets but nothing changed

First i thought that I need to research first internal level but after the research was finished - it was created as duplicate of the room on external side of ship
Then I researched to expand external platform (yellow line [build tile limit]) but after I didn't get how to place new room

P.S. on the whole, i have bought around 2-3 rooms. One before any research and two others after first floor and increasing build tile limit for external platform

P.P.S. "by room" was describe as more challenge option - play for this)

**MFerrari (mod author):** You can only build rooms when on space. For that, open ship terminal, and there will be a big button on the left of the gui terminal panel

**atsuren21 (op):** I see now. Thanks!

Two other pop-up windows always keep on and button got out of focus in front of them.
