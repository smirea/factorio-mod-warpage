**Orna (op):** Hello, just gave up this mod after spending like 30H(+) SOLO trying to make meaningful progress but honestly I wish I could disable this specific mechanic.

I understand it's to prevent creep "turreting" nests but when you spawn on top of a huge explosive biter nest then what can you do besides save scumming ? Waiting the full warp time until your base is half gone ? From what I understand the mod is clearly designed for multiplayer but if you're a solo you're done for, there's no tech to reduce/remove turrets' cooldown nor there's mechanic to remove said cooldown for turrets placed on the ship, like they exists in space but because you teleport somehow it's like they've just been placed ?

I wish you had either a minimum zone around the ship where no enemy can spawn and/or no turrets activation delay and/or tech to reduce/remove it.

Also a way to prevent flamethrowers to ignore explosive biters, I MANUALLY added every single enemy type with the ignore setting just so they won't waste any fuel on these but then the flamethrowers don't aggro the pirates because somehow they don't exists in the enemy list (and no, adding the engineer icon doesn't work).

Anyways, gave up, was fun until the bullshit RNG became unbearable, which seems to be getting worse and worse every time I warp with no clear solution in sight besides save scumming. The concept is very interesting but it's seems the unfairness is just a cheap way to make your friends laugh on discord while you reboot the server, which admittedly is fun the first 5 times but it quickly turns into a frustrating ragequit.

Maybe I missed something in the tech, I saw a defense drone ability somewhere but knowing how terrible they are in the base game I didn't bother spending 10 hours trying them.

**Orna (op):** Here's a clip of what I'm talking about :
<https://www.twitch.tv/orna__/clip/ColorfulLitigiousNeanderthalGrammarKing-ILGa9eZnvZ8AcC6T>

You can see how I started preparing the car AND save scumming before warping in this clip, as well as my will to play this mod vanish as I had to reload an auto save because my manual save bricked my attempt.

**MFerrari (mod author):** ok. next version will only delay when on difficulty level 3+

---
**Orna (op):** Not sure what this difficulty level thing is but I'll probably try again once it's implemented, thanks for listening to my rant lol.

---
**Gredys:** There is actually 2 ways - remove delay or erase nests at some radius around the ship on warp (radius can be tweaked by difficulty as u mentioned before)
But idk how it would be in the caves O..o

---
**Stargateur:** Turret delay shouldn't happen when turret are warped

---
**fbserg:** Turret delay is great, but having it as a separate mod toggle might be the way. Our group loved the fact that you might warp into a danger planet where it's all hands on top deck during warp-in to defend if necessary.

**Gredys:** Sounds more like `option` feature :D

**lis6502:** Personally i don't find turret creeping cheating or making game( even vanilla) much easier. especially when shitloads of pollution makes nests spawn fricking pillgrimages of biters. Currently i am at the cave, had researched ship blast cannon so finally digging through tunnels isn't that much of a pain, but i actually stabilized enough to stay over an hour there( i tough of mining warponium)
What i've found are 2 biter bosses, 2 spitter bosses and tons and tons of small biters overwhelming me with just they number. I've destroyed Giant nest, killed all holes but they still are outnumbering me so instant turrets to actually play and avoid savescumming would be a solution.

Also - pitch black darkness. I kill enemies behind me, move forward just to be attacked by more enemies from behind. While it's tangible in person, driving a tank( because it does decent job in caves) is impossible because i don't see what and where is attacking me. Frustrating.

**Stargateur:** # Contain Spoiler

yeah, boss also is a pain, specially splitter boss that have orbital range that one shot you with 5455464 damage there is not much solution for them, for CaC boss you just need to prepare, but they is not much way to prepare for spitter boss, except artillery turret that are very late game... I still need to work on missile turret stand alone (cause I play without space age) but they have only 36 range... Same with pirate they have more range than turret, they isn't much automatic solution for them. Specially sniper pirate.

**Stargateur:** Oops

**lis6502:** > Same with pirate they have more range than turret, they isn't much automatic solution for them. Specially sniper pirate.

well, i simply run them over with tank while counting seconds till i can warp the hell out of there, so basically babysitting my ship until it's possible to run. Maybe trainsaw tactics would be feasible to sacrifice it instead of base components, need to test it more. And again - turret's cooldown is immense pain when some dude outranges my defenses.
