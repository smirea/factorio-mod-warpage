**Griffork (op):** I'm playing with Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders, and the Beltboxes are only placeable on smelting floor. When it feels like they should be placeable on any floor like chests are.

Is there a way I can configure it so that the Beltboxes are placeable on any floor tile (I'd like to put them in the warp room)?
