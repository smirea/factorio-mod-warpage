**Estabon (op):** I really really enjoy this mod, thanks for making it. I added all of your recommended biters mods, rampant weapons, mining drones, bobs inserters, rpg mod, portal, and faster start for bots. I know bots and mining drones make it waaay easier but it was originally just me and a friend.

I wish there were more random encounters or adventures. I like the mega bitter nests and loved the pirate attack. wish the pirates came more often. Thanks for making such a cool mod. Only suggestions I have are to add more defensive/offensive abilities. The shock bomb seems useless. The defensive drones are meh unless you are actually getting overrun. I wish you had some kind of attack system like spawn a bunch of the pirates to attack outwards in all directions from the warp platform. Or insta spawn a defensvie ring of turrets around the base that disapear once you warp. Mining bomb is awesome but I wish it was a little bigger.
