**BLACKcOPstRIPPa (op):** Character doesn't spawn?

I have tried using only mods on the page for this mod, and the game doesn't spawn my character, it asks if I want cheats enabled, all research etc
but after that nothing happens, map is loaded, I see the ship and whatever starts on the ship but can't do anything, no player character is created.

**BLACKcOPstRIPPa (op):** Okay I'm dumb lol

I was doing sandbox because what I am used to, I needed to go and do the top option to start a new game.
Once I choose the right one everything just worked lol
