**Hypadao (op):** I just reached vulcanus (i had to fight 3 medium demolisher after i spawned at the cross of their 3 territory) and i started using molten metal, so i builded a large tanker zone (37 tanker for each molten metal)
BUT when i am low on molten metal the spaceship pipe just dump their content in the void, i can see the production i produce 35k iron molten metal per minute but i get no consumption on the other side of the pipe, i am not sure what cause this problem but this is not the first time i get this in my playthroug, i already got that after using a lot of tanker for the oil, with the oil getting dumped in the void.

I fixed this problem by using pumps and a condition to be sure that the tanker have enough metal to fill the spaceship pipe before activating the pump, but this bug still cost me something like 1M units of molten iron, so be warned.

Great mod btw
