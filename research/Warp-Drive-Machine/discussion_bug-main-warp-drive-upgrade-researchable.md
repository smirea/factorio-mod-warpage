**Thetawaves666 (op):** Hi MFerrari,

I'm playing a heavy modded factorio + this one. I only "repaired" the terminal once to have access to the Main Warp Drive upgrade 1. I do not know if it's intencional, but it also allowed me to have access to Main Warp Drive upgrade 2. The tecnology Main Warp Drive upgrade 3 is unable to be researched and there are no options to keep repairing the terminal.

The only idea i have is that the mod Science Pack Dependencies somehow screwed the progression. Now I'm unable to progress pass Main Warp Drive upgrade 2.

Is there any command I can use to save this run? (I'm on warp count 51, and really don't want to lose progress).

**MFerrari (mod author):** your load shows you have not researched accumulators tech, required by warp drive 3. Once researched, the terminal will ask for repair items.
I have not donwloaded all your used mods for this test
