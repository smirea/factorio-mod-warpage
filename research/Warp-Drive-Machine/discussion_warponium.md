**Morichalion:** Bumping this. I'm enjoying the mod, but I CANNOT find warponium.

I've got hundreds of warps at this point. I found exactly one cave, I wasn't able to find warponium in it. I DO have chemical science, though

**MFerrari (mod author):** There was a bug before version Version: 0.3.4 Date: 19. 06. 2024. After that, 1/3 of new planets have caves. Also the spaceship will warp underground sometimes. The cave entrance is not shown on the mini map. So, the tip to find it outside is , use the scanner and get your eyes there when it is revealing land. Also get a car and go for a ride. You will probably hit one
