**Sir_AL (op):** Would be nice to have a 5th and maybe a 6th linked chest to handle quality items. Maybe locked behind Legendary research. That way people can get them if they want to go for quality but ignore them if not. Since you don't really need Gleba Science to win the game it wouldn't effect the game much.
