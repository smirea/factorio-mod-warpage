**Player1x (op):** On the new update it looks like there is a required quantum flux core to upgrade the warp machine. Unfortunately after traveling to the planet that supposedly has it, I've searched for countless hours, on the surface and in caves and I don't know if it ever generated it. Is this bugged, or can you provide additional details on what we are looking for. I tried to use the scanner to search for interesting things, and it only keeps dinging cave entrances and I've searched everywhere in them.

---
**Player1x (op):** Nevermind, eventually found the pirate ship that has it. May be worth setting that as a priority for the ship scanner.

---
**Dragonwhisperin:** How DO you find the planet it's on though? It just showed up in the repair requirements with no further notice and I'm clueless.

---
**Player1x (op):** In the planet navigator menu, there will be an icon

---
**Avalyah:** The planet it chose for me is underground. I have searched for an hour but couldn't find it. The ship scanner just shows me some chests. I'm kinda at a loss on how to get it :(

---
**Dragonwhisperin:** There was no icon at all for me. I ended up finally finding it at random in one of the hackable underground complexes.

---
**oggyswe:** so i got a notice that i had one on a planet and then couldent find it in time. and not sure if its actually there have searched a massive area through a ocean of biters.

can it show up on more places or only were its mentioned the first time?

---
**lis6502:** same here, quantum flux core required to repair warp drive but none found. I did few cavexes, found spidertrons, tons of runes and other crap but not the core. Also pirate spaceships( one on planets or in space between planets - yes i don't pay these suckers :D) doesn't have one (yet?).

According to factoriopedia, these are produced by Outpost assembler but there's no tech to craft one. Intentionally or did i found a bug?

**lis6502:** > In the planet navigator menu, there will be an icon
