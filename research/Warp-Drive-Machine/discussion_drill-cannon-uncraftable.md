**gezuppe (op):** The drill cannon requires a pistol as ingredient, which normally cannot be crafted, and most people throw the one they have away. I didn't find another tech that would re-add the pistol recipe, and even if there was one, it should be a prerequisite for the drill cannon tech.

**nightshroud2020:** Just respawn. I got killed and then got the pistol again.

**gezuppe (op):** Yep, just happened to mee, too :)
