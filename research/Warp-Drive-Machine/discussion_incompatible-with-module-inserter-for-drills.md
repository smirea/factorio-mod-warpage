**Telokis (op):** Hello!

I tried using Module Inserter Extended with Warp Drive Machine to easily configure modules for my drills but I noticed it wouldn't work unless they're ghost entities.
I've created a thread on their mod page ([Link](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ModuleInserterEx/discussion/68d3d1f5d5cee1d1b920cbf2)) but in their reply they say:

> I think the solution is for the Warp Drive Machine mod to update and allow creation of the "item-request-proxy" entity type anywhere.

Do you think it could be possible? Would it have unintended side effects on other parts of the mod? Thank you in advance!
