**WeasleyWells (op):** Currently doing a playthrough with a couple other on a server using WDM with Space Age enabled. The playthrough up to unlocking SA planets felt great, at difficulty 3 we had to stay on our toes and run away plenty of times from planets that could just ruin our platform and boss enemies.
After unlocking the SA planets the playthrough went downhill quick and all the unique things about this mod became tedious by having to manually warp the platform between a cave planet(for warporium), Vulcanos, Fulgora and Gleba. By being able to build big bases on these planets and previously not being able to get these unique resources anywhere else(latest update addresses that) you're kinda forced to build bases there. Gleba is the bigger annoyance here where you have to go there or your science is just gonna sit and spoil.

I would love for the gameplay to be altered similar to non SA playthrough where the platform is the only place you can permanently build things until you get the home planet tech(which would be moved to needing Fulgora, Gleba and Vulcanos packs).
By allowing the silo to be placed on some of the normal planets you warp to it would add another situation where your in a hurry to launch a couple of rockets and then you have to leave(maybe make silo trigger attacks like resource suckers?).

I really like the idea of researching Vulcanos tech and then getting planets with calcite and lava and same with the different resources from the other SA planets. Would also be interesting to have the SA resources always be available but because you don't have the tech it's not something you can use yet allowing you to just stockpile a bunch of items in preparation.

All in all I think the mod is good but just needs to stick more to what makes it great instead of allowing massive bases to be built up on different planets making the platform feel useless in everything but allowing you to travel between planet to planet.

**MFerrari (mod author):** I played with some friends and each one was excited to make things on SA planets.. so it is kind of a personal taste. some stayed working on SA planets, other prefered to stay on the ship... BTW, gleba is not necessary here...
