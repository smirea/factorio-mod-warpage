**NIKITAzed (op):** I might be the dumb one, or it might just be one of those cases of play further to find out, but it says to unlock some techs I need to repair the warp drive in the spaceship terminal, but when I open it, I don't see any option to do that ?

**MFerrari (mod author):** should be a big green button when you open the main terminal...

**NIKITAzed (op):** Believe it or not I found it a little after posting that, just like I predicted, but I was mostly done with it and just needed to contribute repair packs and it reset and added more other stuff I had to contribute ?
