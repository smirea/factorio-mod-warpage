**Divine-Ray (op):** So apparently i have met a threshold or limit of shaceship chests that the mod does not tell you about. Okay, ish, annoying, but mitigatable with the tier 2 and 3s.
However, removing an existing one does not decrement this counter (if there's any) to the point where i (could) have crippled my factory/platform into not functioning.
I have mined the chests with my player character and was trying to place the new chest on the third floor (enabled via config), but the issue was persistent even with ground level.

**VasiliyS:** I have the same issue now :( <https://disk.yandex.ru/d/_2Anjs13h9KiuA>

**VasiliyS:** I looked into the code and found that limits are set to 12. For some reason I have much more of the chests built, like 30+. So if I remove one I still above the limit. Have limits changed recently?..

**nightshroud2020:** Yes, it was an update ago or two. You can change it from settings.
