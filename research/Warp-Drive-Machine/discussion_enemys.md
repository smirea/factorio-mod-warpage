**ArtyAeterna (op):** Are there any planes to integrate the new space age enemys into this mod?

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** what enemies ?

---
**ArtyAeterna (op):** The wrigglers/straffers/stompers from gleba, or the demolishers from vulcanus

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** when playing with space age, these planets are there, discovered on tech + warp... and the enemies are all there in their respective planets

---
**ArtyAeterna (op):** What i mean is if there is chance that they will appear on the random generated planets the warp ship sends you to, sorry if my explainign was a bit funky
