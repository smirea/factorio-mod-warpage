**PlzPuddngPlz:** Super late post but how are they supposed to work? I can place one outside of the ship but the items don't seem to go anywhere.

Edit: nevermind, went back and read the change notes from that time. For anyone else wondering, chests can only be placed in the storage room once unlocked.
