**fi5hii (op):** when you buy fluids on the stationary space stations the warp pipe doesn't transfer everything, there is 999 left even tho I have 3 pumps on the other side... please fix this

**Heavenfox:** This is easily solved/worked around by having pumps on both ends of the warp pipe, kinda annoying, yes, but extremely easy to fix

**fi5hii (op):** yeah I know it's easily fixable by bringing a pump with you but then in early game you have to wire power and all and it's just annoying + factorio went out of theur way to make fluids amazing in 2.0 and this just feels like a step back to 1.1 fluid mechanics
