**GreenEyedPhoenix (op):** My sister and I are doing a playthrough and we've been through countless caves and cannot figure out what a certain cave room is for. It's the ones with the gray gridded floor, surrounded by walls, with an inserter, a pipe to ground, and an iron box. Has anybody figured out what they're for or what they do?

**Faenyx:** We found one! FYI, the gates do not stop you if you are in mech armor.
