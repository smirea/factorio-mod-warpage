**KuGua33 (op):** Is there an option in the team competition mod to reset a team's ship? Some teams can no longer play, and I want to reset them.

**MFerrari (mod author):** unfortunatelly, there is no option for that

**KuGua33 (op):** This is very bad. I hope to make a function that allows me to reset those abandoned teams and attract more new players to join.
