**FerriteMask (op):** I finished the mod with my friend, it was a ton of fun and I really liked it overall but one complaint I have is how small the hitbox on pirates is, it even seems to be a bit offset from sprite itself some times, like it's rectangular with one face being really tiny and hitting at some angles with cannon shells is nigh impossible, I had to switch to guns and rockets just so I can hit them reliably
