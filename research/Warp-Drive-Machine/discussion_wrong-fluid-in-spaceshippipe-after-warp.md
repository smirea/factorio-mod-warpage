**GoTo_53 (op):** I get the flashing wrong fluid sign in after finally finding Fulgora. I have in the Storage room a tank for every fluid I have to buffer. So since I found fulgora I set up a tank for Holmium solution and electrolite. They have each their fluiddrop as signal set up in the pipe.
On the surface I have two EM-Plants. The left is producing electrolyte soring into the buffer and the other directly connected EM-Plant is making fulgora science. I have spaceshippipes connecting directly the holmium and heavy oil from their buffers.
On warping from fulgora into space somehow elctrolyte got into the heavy oil pipe at the EM plant making the electrolyte and in the holmium pipe in the science EM-Plant. after clearing (deleting the ~20 elctrolyte) the pipe after the minute ran and every warp after building it it happens.

Another thing I would like to request are tiny floors where I can produce the planet related recepies (especially science) on the warp ship. Cost could be like 2k of that science. It's really annoying to set recepies again after reloading on another day and the contents inside the buildings with surface not fitting recepies get deleted (modules as well). That way I can use the dedicated room after researching it and don't have to babysit them.
