**pentaquark (op):** I'm really enjoying this mod so far, thanks for making it. However, some sound effects are too loud, such as the planet charting ability. Whenever I use that, I need to turn down the volume quite a bit or it's uncomfortably loud. Could you reduce the volume of that sound effect?

There's a few other sounds that are a bit too loud, but I don't remember which ones, and none of them (that I've heard) are as loud as this one.
