**Avrely (op):** Hi!
I put boilers and steam engines on the platform level and storage tank at level 1, then connected with spaceship pipe. Storage tanks filled with steam at temperature 15 C. When I try to use this steam when boilers are empty, steam engines do not work. I think spaceship pipe resets temperature of the liquid.
