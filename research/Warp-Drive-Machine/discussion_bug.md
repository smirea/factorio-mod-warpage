**SpoonGER (op):** Hello, first of all thanks for your great mod.
When I went into warp earlier, the area of the spaceship turned black, the map hadn't changed.
After the warp ended, the spaceship stayed black and I died 10 seconds later.

I have uploaded a screenshot of the warp jump for you here.

I hope it helps you.

Best regards

**fefs80:** Just FYI we had this issue last week whilst playing, my friend warped OK but I got left behind on a black ship hole and died 10 seconds later. We figured it might have been because I was standing on a diagonal edge between two floor surfaces and later noticed belts etc vanishing there so I might have been standing on the planets surface through the platform if that makes sense? We now always stand in the middle of a coloured section when warping and haven't had any issues since :)
