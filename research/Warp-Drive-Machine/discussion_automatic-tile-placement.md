**Nimrenyi (op):** Building on the spaceship and later home-planet requires the correct spaceship-tiles/concrete. Unfortunately these tiles are not automatically placed underneath when you put down a blueprint.
Furthermore bots will try to place the item and then just drop it to the ground (without an automatic deconstruct).

A landfill like beahaviour for all necesssary tiles would be much appreciated
