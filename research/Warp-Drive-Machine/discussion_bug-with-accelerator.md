**Draugo (op):** Description says that it cuts the warp timer in half but no matter how many times I activate it it does nothing.

Personally I'd much rather have warptorio style "Warp" button early since both the pirates and big biters are just impossible to deal with without either using some really OP mods or just packing everything and reatreating to the other floors which is just boring gameplay and doesn't even work unless you make the terminal indestructible. There are just planets where I have no desire to hang around but with no way of affecting the warp timer I just resort to cheese more and more to keep the game fun. Even the ship cannon hardly does anything and the combat drones just hang around the terminal without moving.
