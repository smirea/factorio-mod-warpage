**mamc (op):** First great extension, love it!

Just a thing: sometimes the warp resource sucker just stops working and says it's "disabled by script". It is placed on ore, there are free Acid tiles and is has power.

Is there a intended hidden challenge I just don't get or do I do something wrong or might there be a bug?

**mamc (op):** Ok sorry, forget it, there was actually no free Acid tile. I did just not see it
