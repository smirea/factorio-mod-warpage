**rferriz (op):** Hello!

I landed INSIDE a planet and the warp button was "broken". I could not craft resources needed to make it work, so I expected to only rely on AutoWarp to go to next planet to gather resources and repair the button. But when AutoWarp should kick in, Factorio crashed with something related to "Could not find warp button"

Sorry for not being able to give a proper bug report, but I rage-delete the mod when I saw the bug :-)

**MFerrari (mod author):** Unfortunatellty I need the game crash log to know what was the problem...
