**Alwego (op):** One planet from space age are not persistent.
I was change settings (space age planets are persistent 0 -> 1) in middle game (i change mind in half of game) and when i come back to vulcanus, make some buldings/setup there, go to other planet, and come back later i must start every thing from zero. Fulgora works ok.
I change settings about planet, week ago, when i was on vulcanus.
Any chance to fix this? I have 80hr in this save so restart game will be painfull :D

**MFerrari (mod author):** Once the surface was deleted ( probably because you changed the setting ) there is no way to fix it.. unless you have a backup saved game

**Alwego (op):** I was afraid to hear that. Well... that's mean i can start new, and build better factory =)
