**HeZlah (op):** Hey all,

SPOILER WARNING
SPOILER WARNING

I'm 33 hour into my run, unlocked Vulcanus a few hours ago, wanted to share some impressions about pacing and resource management - especially before and after unlocking space science and space age planets. Almost managed to do it without any save-scum. But after getting ripped to threads by 2x medium demolishers upon landing on Vulcanus the first time, ended up loading back a bit and rushing out uranium ammo.

Early game (Pre-Space Age planets):
Pacing is a bit slow and tedious, but that isn't all bad, kind of the point of the mod and why I played in the first place. But it is disappointing that some of the fun tech is locked behind space science, which has production and utility science reqs. Eg Logistic system tech, T2+ modules. I love the linked chests and using them to solve the logistics challenges of the space platform, but I hate being locked into using them. Even after unlocking logistic system, 99% of my base is still linked chests, loaders and sushi belts. But o boy do I appreciate that 1% which is logistics and would have loved it earlier.
The amount of productivity available makes sustaining even single digit purple/yellow science pretty tedious. I rarely found planets with more than 2 resources on them. By the time I fill one buffer, the rest are empty.
This constant lack of resources and being at the whim of rng is expected (and desired) in playing this mod. but can feel a bit unbalanced at times. Literally spawning in the middle of a massive nest of worms after having baron planets for the last 4 warps is frustrating. Just got to hide downstairs and let floor0 get deleted until you find a good planet and can start over.

Late Game (after unlocking Vulcanus)
After unlocking Vulcanus, the whole balance flips. I just went there for the foundries.. but I'm finding no reason to leave. Vulcanus is persistent and I can ramp up production to pull orders of magnitude more resources than I can with time spent at any other warp. So, I just extend as long as I can on Vulcanus then, when warp timer expires I do quick warps until I can set destination back to Vulcanus. The only reason I have to leave is to either go to other space age planets to pick up science; or go to home planet to launch some space science. I'm not really keen on setting up my 200th mining outpost :p

I know there is a final pirate boss to kill, but at this point is just feels like another space age playthrough. I'm only a few hours past Vulcanus, just unlocked Fulgora, so I hope there are some more interesting mechanics to play with.

It would be really cool if unlocking additional planets just meant that those resources could start spawning on random planets. Keep the feeling of the warp drive going. And if the tech distance to logistics, modules and other useful tech was a but shorter.

All in all, loving this mod, almost as much as I did warptorio.

**Deckerda:** I've recently become obsessed with these warptorio-esque mods. I went through Warptorio 2.0 (Space Age) and now working on Warp Drive Machine. I have not unlocked the other planets yet, but reading your comment here I can see why this change in pacing would be very jarring. There's a lot I like about Warp Drive Machine (basically every mechanic not inherent to vanilla Factorio has been fantastic so far), but I have to say the way other planets were handled in Warptorio 2.0 (Space Age) is quite nice. There's a natural progression of adding the other planets long before unlocking space science, and once unlocked they are reset between warps so you still can't set up permanent bases. Plus, enemies still spawn on every planet (on theme with each planet if you have all the enemy type mods active) which keeps the pressure on while you rush to collect resources before warping out again. It all felt very naturally integrated with the warptorio style gameplay.
I think Warp Drive Machine has a lot more going for it overall and also love the mod so far, but I do miss the smooth integration of other planets early in the tech tree.

**MFerrari (mod author):** added a mod option to make spage age planets NOT persistent

**Stargateur:** I think persistent planet are not in the spirit of warp drive machine even home planet, but I don't see how to do gleba without persistent gleba. It would be great to have special floor or tiles for gleba fruit production
