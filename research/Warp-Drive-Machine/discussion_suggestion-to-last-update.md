**Alex_R (op):** You can add some pirate techologies you get from their ship unoptainable in other way. And maybe add microcomputer-like entity that outputs always for example one computer signal. You place it near ship terminal and start hacking (like you want to prevent any viruces getting to your ship terminal). And you can place them any ammount to increase hacking speed. And so the more you place them the bigger chances of successful hacking.
