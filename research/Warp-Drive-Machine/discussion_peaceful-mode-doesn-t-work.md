**foxoftheasterisk (op):** I started a game on peaceful mode but I'm still being attacked by biters. Can you either make peaceful mode work or provide some similar functionality for those of us that don't want to deal with the defensive aspect of the game?

Guess I don't get to play this mod.

(I really like the idea of having to pack up your factory every so often & working with limited space & checking out new planets, so I hoped...)
