**denspb (op):** There are new mods that add new planets (e.g. <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Starmap_Nexuz> links a few of them).

While not all of them are directly compartible with WDM, it still probably makes sense to have some mechanism to extend list of "persistent planets" for WDM from just "vulcanus/gleba/fulgora/aquilo". It can be an comma-separated mod config option, or script interface that would allow compatibility mod to register new planet as persistent.

**MFerrari (mod author):** Any expansion or moded planet is already considered "persistent". If it is compatible with WDM thats another question...
