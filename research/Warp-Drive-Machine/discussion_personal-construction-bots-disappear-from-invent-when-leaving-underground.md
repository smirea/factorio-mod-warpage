**EntityCrethus (op):** Hey there, not sure if this one is known, but I've noticed a few times that all of my personal construction bots (in my inventory) disappear when leaving an entirely underground map.

Doesn't seem to matter how many are in my inventory - and it's not when they are flying about on jobs, only when in the inventory do they disappear.

**EntityCrethus (op):** Oh, worth noting they are the only item that I 'save' a spot for in my inventory (right at the bottom, so i can easily see how many I've got).
