**DrColossus (op):** I have been playing a multiplayer game of Warp Drive Machine for a few days now, but last night we encountered a crash. It was our first encounter with a pirate spaceship in space. The game crashes when we warp out the encounter (the autosave popped about 40 seconds before this, so I have been able to reproduce). We are not using any mods other than the recommended dependencies for WDM.

I don't know if this is relevant, but during our fight the autowarp activated and we used the stabiliser ability to extend our time. However, the warp power up sound had already started playing. During the actual warp out, the sound doesn't play, so I wonder if the game is confused about the warp?

PS I do have the save file, but I can't see how to attach it to this post. I have also checked the factorio log file, but there's nothing interesting in there (the last entry is the lobby initialising prior to the crash).

We were originally playing on 1.0.5, but after updating 1.0.11 the crash still occurs.

**DrColossus (op):** Double post in error

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** Please post the crash error message here. The saved file would also help

---
**DrColossus (op):** There's no error message, just a hard CTD. I have the save file to hand but I can't see how to attach it to this message

**SergioTT:** Same problem found in version 1.0.10. Tried updating to 1.0.14 but the problem persists.
