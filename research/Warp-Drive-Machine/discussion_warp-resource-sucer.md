**VegaOrionis (op):** Warp Resource Sucer - How to use this machine to make it work?

---
**MFerrari (mod author):** First. Place some resource tiles (acid color) somewhere on your ship. Then place the machine on a good ore Path. Provide a lot of power. Wait, survive, and the ore is warped to that ship tile

---
**VegaOrionis (op):** Oh, thank you, that actually works! :) But the building itself is so nonsensical...

---
**Wwombatt:** Doesnt work on warponium?
