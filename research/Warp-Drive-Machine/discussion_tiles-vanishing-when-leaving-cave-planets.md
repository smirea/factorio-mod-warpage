**Treephie (op):** When departing cave/underground locations, not all tiles go with the ship, and some are lost. This isn't as much of a problem with the tiles mode, but with rooms mode, the entire room needs to be rebuilt to restore the lost tiles. With the central platform, there is no current way to restore lost tiles, even with the editor. This has been a problem for a quite a while.

In addition, when purchasing rooms, the surrounding tiles outside the main shape are discarded on landing, as they are regular concrete, resulting in a lot of empty spaces between rooms.
The workaround I discovered was to place walls on top of path to space stations, which results in tutorial tiles where the space station path was. This suggests it's not intented behaviour.

**MFerrari (mod author):** try the new version. I'm afraid you will need to rebuild the previous rooms

**Treephie (op):** That helps a lot, thanks so much!
