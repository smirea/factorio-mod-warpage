**Estabon (op):** Our ship has been repaired and we are no longer able to determine where we are warping to. I select the planets i want to go to on the destination list and hit return to planet. says destination selected, for instance planet #75. When we warp, we are put to a random planet. I also launched the pirate probe and not able to get to their planet. On the planet i select the planet and when it stops in space during warp i again select the planet.

:( I want to see the final pirate battle lol. Let me know if i need to share anything like our save etc.

**Estabon (op):** Nvm... we had to let it scan fully. we were jumping the gun and hitting warp early.
