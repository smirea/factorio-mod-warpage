**darkszero (op):** Repairing the ship requires Red Wire, but Red Wire is removed by <https://mods.factorio.com/mod/WireShortcuts>.

**GoguSpatzialu:** Have you tried the Settings -> Mod settings -> Wire shortcuts -> Keep wires in recipes? No clue, but it might fix it, if I understand what it does correctly. Though considering Factorio 2.0 is removing wires, it might be a good idea to change the recipe anyway.
