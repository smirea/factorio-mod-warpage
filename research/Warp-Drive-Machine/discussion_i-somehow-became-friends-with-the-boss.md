**Hodar3 (op):** It was one of those five-legged creatures. I teleported into space with it on the ship and immediately noticed that it simply retreated into a corner and stopped attacking. The turrets also stopped hitting it. I could only attack it by holding down Shift. Anyway, later, when we landed on another planet, it ran off into the depths of the map, attacking the Biters. I still received damage notifications, as if it were my own building.
Damn, if next time it's one of those that can't get over a wall, I'll keep it as a pet =(

Translated via Google, sorry for any inaccuracies
