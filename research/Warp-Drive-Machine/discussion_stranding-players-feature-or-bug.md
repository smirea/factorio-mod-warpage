**NeoChaos12 (op):** I started playing this mod solo with v1.0.8 and at the time, it was impossible to get stranded on a planet when the platform warps away as the platform would "pull" me along no matter where on the planet surface I was. I thought it's a great feature for solo players since it affords some flexibility in terms of time management and I just didn't find it fun to have my run end because I got stranded. Then v1.0.10 "fixed" this so that players are stranded, which is likely good for multiplayer late-game once you can control where you teleport to but just a nuisance in single player. My suggestion - make this a toggleable mod option. IMO for single player playthroughs, being stranded doesn't really add as much value as a challenge as being pulled along with the platform adds in terms of gameplay flexibility.
