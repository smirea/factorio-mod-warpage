**PHIDIAS0303 (op):** there are too many events in the gameplay. almost every 2 to 3 planets will have a pirate, and then a boss...

**TSP:** And on the easiest setting, we also got pirates at like warp 27 with almost the minimum amount of ship upgrades, we got slaughtered in no time. We play with 2-4 people online. They outrange our turrets, have more health than Big Biters (450 or so?), and they come in waves. The only way to kill them is to go out there yourself, but then you just get sniped to death.

Furthermore, the auto-warp is set at a short time, way before big biters even get time to spawn (Evo ~33-35%). But these pirates come at you at like minute 5 with vastly superior gear.

Again, on the EASIEST difficulty. We tried it twice now, first session was about 27 hours of playtime and the second about 9 or so, playing quite seriously trying to take advantage of everything given to us and we even use certain cheat features (the second time) such as fast movement speed. It made absolutely no difference.

Please just change the difficulty from [1 (Easy)-5 (Impossible)] to [1 (Toddler) - 6 (Old Easy) - 10 (Old Impossible)] because it took the fun out of the game. We're still trying to power through the second session after reloading saves a few times.

**TSP:** Quick request: Add in a mod setting to disable any and all pirate events. Please!
