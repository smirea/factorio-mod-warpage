**Sir_AL (op):** If I decide to fight the pirates in space and am still fighting them after 10-15 minutes, my game crashes. However, it's not a mod crash where it tells you what part of a mod did it, but a game one. It's happened 3-4 times. If I kill them quickly or pay tribute it doesn't seem to be a problem.
