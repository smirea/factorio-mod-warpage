**Norrius (op):** I put an acid tile for the ore, now I can't remove it (or build it up), and nothing can be built on it. How do I remove tiles?

**Norrius (op):** Almost immediately, I learned the necessary technology that allows me to remove tiles.
The topic cannot be deleted, I will leave this knowledge here for future generations.
