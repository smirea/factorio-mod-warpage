**Xenor13 (op):** Hello,
we are playing in multiplayer and the enemy bases are all empty (without any "buildings"), only the biomass is there.
Also the fishes in the water areas are spitting acid.

**MFerrari (mod author):** If you have a saved game i can check it. Krastorio ? About the spititting fishes. Yeah.. they are agressive on some planets

**Xenor13 (op):** Here is a saved game:

we Have Krastorio 2 and some other Mods

**MFerrari (mod author):** Just checked here... On other planets the nests are there, but in less quantity, maybe a rampant config ? I dont know... Also I could confirm that the ruin mod removed biters nest. to place its entities. When this happen, krastorio saw there was a nest there, and added the biomass, but then ruins removed it.
I'l recommend remove the rampant mod. It is a great mod for normal playstyle, but I dont think it would be a good thing here when jump from planet to planet....

**Xenor13 (op):** Thanks for your quick reply and help.
We'll try it out.
