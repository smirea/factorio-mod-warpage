**Sir_AL (op):** Would be nice if there was a circuit signal for when you are warping. Something you are able to toggle like the "Read charge level" for the terminal. I'm sure there are other uses, but the reason I'm interested in it would be so I can turn off the system to send items to planet. Because of the lag time of bots, belts, and inserters the items in route sometimes end up on next planet.
