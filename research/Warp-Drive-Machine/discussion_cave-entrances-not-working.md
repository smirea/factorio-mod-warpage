**izzet_the_bard (op):** Hey, I've been enjoying the mod thus far, but am having an issue where clicking on the first cave entrance I've found doesn't open the cave, but instead opens it in a GUI window as a working storage chest/inventory with only a single slot (and in factoriopedia, shows that it will yield 1 x wooden chest).

This is the only overhaul mod that im running, and the problem persisted after testing the following — disabling all non-dependent/required mods (which then remained disabled), cloning the entity in editor, spawning in new copies of both entrance versions (as well as the exit for good measure) on the pre-existing surface, and finally spawning them anew on a freshly generated surface, none of which worked so I'm stumped.

I've attached a link to a screenshot from in-game, as well of my modlist from when the planet's surface was initially generated, thanks heaps <3

**MFerrari (mod author):** Entering a cave requires a valid character very close to the entrance.
