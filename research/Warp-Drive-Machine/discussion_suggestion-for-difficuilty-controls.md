**denspb (op):** I feel that curve is well-tuned on the "challenge" side, but it might make sense to give a bit of control for fine-tuning "advancement" side of the play, to make it adjustable for single player-play.

Few ideas:
\* Make probability of beneficial events (lost ship, space station, hidden cave) mod options
\* Make a number of items availabe in the space station marked a configurable option
\* Make the planet index when uranium becomes available again/home planet can be assigned a mod option
