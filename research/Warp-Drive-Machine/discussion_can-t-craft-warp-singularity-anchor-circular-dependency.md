**Stargateur (op):** Main warp drive upgrade 9 require Warp Singularity Anchor, to craft it you require science pack but it's itself necessary to unlock science pack.

BTW 500 efficiently module is a LOT when I don't even have a single module crafting machine XD. Okay I looted some and looted somehow 10 science pack too but I don't think it's expected to craft it using loot only.
