**Stargateur (op):** It would be nice that when we switch position between floors to get where we last was. It's a bit annoying to always be at center. If at some point the old position doesn't contains tiles just reset position to center.

At the same time it would be nice to be able to set a shortcut key to switch between floors. Prev, next, and maybe direct shortcut to go to specific floor room.
