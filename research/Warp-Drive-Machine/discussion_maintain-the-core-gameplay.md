**mtan (op):** I really like your mod. However, after unlocking the home planet or even Vulcanus, the game almost becomes vanilla factorio. Upgrading the platform or building anything on it loses its significance. Is it possible to add a platform-only game mode in the starting options? This mode would prohibit manufacturing on planets, delete terrain when the platform leaves, and allow rocket silos to be built on the platform

**crowmang:** I hope not. The game already wasted enough of your time even after bots. The only light at the end of my 45hr tunnel is leaving the platform and never stepping foot on it again.

And let me be clear, I do like the gameplay loop, but if there is no incentive for advancement, you're stuck hand placing miners until the end of the game, which is an awful design. There is a distinct lack of tangible upgrades compared to Warptorio so having the means to leave and never look back fills that void.

some people like it... some don't...
isnt it better to do not play space age if you dont like the work on planets ?

**mtan (op):** Yes, some people enjoy it while others don’t... That’s exactly why I suggest adding a starting option to switch between the two gameplay modes. With the new mode, original core goal has always been to build a powerful platform，not to shift its purpose to becoming a transport vessel after reaching Vulcanus..SA planets unlocks unique minerals and recipes, which allow the platform to be upgraded for greater productivity. This extension aligns with the core goal established at the start. Of course, this is just my perspective,thank you all the same for creating such a fantastic mod!

**MFerrari (mod author):** Thank you. A mod option is always the best solution... Will think about it

**DannyUS:** Is it not already possible to get back to platform-only mode by just not enabling space age? Yes, you will miss out on quality and SA buildings, but its a workaround in case the option to switch modes is not added.

**The360MlgNoscoper:** It would be nice then if space age content could be implemented into the mod loop? That with a new tech new planets can generate with the different new ores, or with lava and stuff.
