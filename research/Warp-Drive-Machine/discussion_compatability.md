**Techlich (op):** It says the mod is compatible with Krastorio 2. I was wondering if you knew whether or not it was compatible with K2 spaced out, or the extended endgame mods for either.
Or while I'm asking, if it is compatible with AAI industries (besides the loaders) or the BZ ore mods.

**Techlich (op):** Thanks (especially for the quick feedback). Just checking.
