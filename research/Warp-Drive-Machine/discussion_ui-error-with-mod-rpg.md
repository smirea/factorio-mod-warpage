**Mobius1 (op):** When using the mod "RPG" the WDM UI gets hidden permanently until the ship warps making us unable to change surfaces or interact with the machine

**Gredys:** It is an issue with RPG mod itself. It does same to many other mods.
Ticket is created on their side. Currently disabled it cos unplayable.
