**Stargateur (op):** Would be nice to have autosave frequently, like every warp would be nice

<https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/classes/LuaGameScript.html#auto_save>

launched

```
auto_save("warp_starting")
auto_save("warp_launched")
auto_save("station")
```

etc... this would help a lot player who do not want to be punish too hard for missing a warp or die
