**ak86 (op):** would be nice if ship repairs were fixed like at beginning of game and not scale to insane ammount of relatively engame/current tech resources
merchant should also have somekind of overhaul, barter doesnt work, it needs so much trash to buy something you need it becomes irrelevant

well.. i've lasted to 163 planets, until i landed in cave, that is pretty much game over, its likely impossible to find warp button, there is no way its possible to gather all those resources\fluids required to repair lost warp button / warp engine, and survive 20+ minutes under endless waves(per planet) with limited iron/ammo

well mod was an interesting experience, guess its time to go back to vanilla
