**lis6502 (op):** Well, i was utterly glad when i spared resources for warp chests AND actually having their inventories shared amongst all of chests; i could mine two patches at once and "worry" only about checking "H"(arvester?:D) floor from time to time due to troughput limitations of 8 fast inserters doing their best.

What i was surely not so fond about was the same mechanics of warp pipe. There are extremally expensive so i made two pairs (4 pieces) hoping that they are paired somehow and i will be able to pump water as well as oil. No luck, i have to micromanage which liquid resource i am interesed in more. Is there a research which allows me later in game to have like separate pipes?

To not only complain: i am a Warptorio veteran and seeing Warp drive compatible with Factorio > 1.1 was a instant download and another cracktorio session (it's 4th day, flies in apartament made petition to force me to take a shower ;) ). While idea is similar i like how it loosely is based on (if anything). Combat and resource grinding are especially fun when ship can stay > 20 mins on single surface, concept of dedicated tiles to place special entities is a pain in the ass but also is nice addition, especially that tiles can be bought and aren't THAT expensive to craft. On the flip side they should be minable earlier like first tier from 60 red sci or have higher probability of actually returing a tile since 1st tier.

Also: caves. I love them as much as i hate them ;p There should be a jackhammer or tool alike to ease exploration; even with help of shotgun( and biters from the other side) cavexploration takes too much time giving in return a trickle of resources.

**MFerrari (mod author):** Hi, yes, there are more warp pipes in technology
Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions.. humm a digging tool =)

**lis6502 (op):** Okay, indeed i checked in editor mode and yes, 2nd tier creates separate system.

My pleasure :)
Maybe it wouldn't be a great development challenge to mark on technology screen or on factoriopedia (alt+click) that same 'level' of pipe creates single liquid system?

at the moment every kind of pipe has same description.
edit: okay, on technology screen( where researches are queued there is description that each pipe allows other fluid, my bad, sorry).

Cavex really has potential to be more interesting aspect of Warp Drive. Take for instance big rooms with worms - they are pitch black. A flare could be handy in such situations ( made from coal, warponium plates and wood, because for a moment wood mainly clutters inventory and you don't get it as much to consider it as a viable backup fuel); acting like a Lamp entity but throwable and wherever it lands it stays lit for 30, 120, 300 seconds (tiers of research) and light radius also dependent on research level. Despite being hot it doesn't deal damage, just provides light.

For jackhammer - special fuel for it could be made in chem plant out of warponium( ore? plate? only these i've found in crashed ships so far) and some iron pieces for a small container, just as Krastorio 2's fuel for vehicles. Equipable like a weapon with fuel as ammo( variation of flamethrower?).

I mean, if only source of warponium ore are crashed spaceships and caves, it should have legitimate use case in said caves in the first place.
Another addition for cavex freaks - sonar( warponium plate, radar, green circuit, steel plate, programmable speaker[ because why not ;d] ), a single use item, stackable to 5 allowing to map 10 chunks deep and 2 chunks wide area in direction of engineers facing with probability of uncovering less or not work at all.
Yeah, your mod inspires me :D
