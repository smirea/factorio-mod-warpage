**-cum-monster- (op):** It seems like when i have multiple spaceship pipes with separate link id's paired that only the first set will function. i have two pipes set to a red tree link to carry oil on the main spaceship platform, and another set that's supposed to handle water, but it wont transfer any water between the main floor or any other floors of the spaceship.
