**Kadet123 (op):** If I place a miniloader against a chest, it'll pull items out of the chest until a warp occurs. Then they won't pull from the chest anymore unless I pick them up and place them again.

Tested with a plain wooden chest as well as warp chests.

**MFerrari (mod author):** miniloader mod is really having issues on cloning. Use earendel's one, as recommended. AAI Loaders
