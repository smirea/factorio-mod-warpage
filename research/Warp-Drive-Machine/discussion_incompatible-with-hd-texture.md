**ZRedplayer (op):** This mod seems to be unable to load because it is incompatible during a HD-Factorio Space Age Texture is installed,
it beefing with your mod literey

Error while running setup for entity prototype "warp\_pipe\_1" (pipe-to-ground): next\_upgrade target (kr-steel-pipe-to-ground) must have the same fast\_replaceable\_group (pipe != warp\_pipe\_1).

factorio\_hd\_age\_space\_age\_base (1.0.0) is conflicting with (your mod)

**MFerrari (mod author):** I have just loaded wdm with factorio\_hd\_age\_space\_age\_base with no problem

**ZRedplayer (op):** New problem:
Error in assignID: technology with name 'promethium-science-pack' does not exist. It was removed by Warp-Drive-Machine.
Source: Quantum-Tech (technology).

why your mod make problem with the other mod Quantum-diffuser ???

**MFerrari (mod author):** There is no platforms and space travel like vanilla in warpdrivemachine; It was all removed to make it compatible with warp drive game style
