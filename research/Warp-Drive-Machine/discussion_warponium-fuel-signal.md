**JulianSkies (op):** Both question and idea: Is there a signal that tells me how much warponium fuel the ship has?

I'd like to somewhat automate making warponium fuel without eating through my plates, wanna keep at a decent level of fuel instead of relying on filling the tank.

**MFerrari (mod author):** adding next version
