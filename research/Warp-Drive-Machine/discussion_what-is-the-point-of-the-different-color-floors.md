**DarkShadow44 (op):** Like, you have "Smelting" "Power" "Assembling" floors, what is the difference? I mean, you can build everything on any floor, right?

EDIT: Okay I noticed that apparently green is special and you can build anything there, sorry that wasn't obvious to me. But it's a bit annoying that you can overbuild the "good" green tiles, and don't get them back.
