**Alyssa333 (op):** Hello
I've researched the home planet tech thing
I've opened the planet info panel
I've clicked the known planets button
I've clicked on the veryyy small home planet button
A new window opens, it says "Select a planet to call home" but it won't let me click to any planet whatsoever

How?

**Paxi:** I think you are referring to having the numbered buttons inactive!?

**Paxi:** I think it's related to the available planets and the difficulty... I read that you can only select planets that are difficult enough
