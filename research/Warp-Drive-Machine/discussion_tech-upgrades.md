**nightshroud2020 (op):** Hi,
I got the Space Age planets unlocked and I found that I get upgrades just from the mod available in shop or hacking. I just get for mining and steel. Is it possible to change that through the playthrough or it is something that I should have done from the begging?
And a small suggestion: with the mod, I feel like the space age tech is very costly compared with the ones from the mod. It is possible to balance it a little?
