**DannyUS (op):** Hello, We have been playing this mod for some time with my friends and we noticed that recently there was a change in how many warp chests you can put down. I am aware that this is a mod setting (and we turned it off). Can the limit be mentioned in the description of the chests? We were not sure what is happening before reading the mod change log.

However, we do like to have a logistic challenge it imposes so some limitation is nice to have. But the current implementation of 12 limit seems counter productive, provided that the warp chests are currently the ONLY way to move stuff between spaceship floors. Would it be possible to add/modify one of the following things to go along with the new limits:

Add a research that will increase the limit of warp chests OR add a new warp underground belt (with linking similar to fluid pipes) so that we have a way other than chests to move stuff between floors.

Thank you for the mod otherwise and even if there is no change, we will continue to play with it, just with limits off :)

**JulianSkies:** There are multiple tiers of warp chests, 5 I believe.

You can use those multiple tiers to give you more tools to move things between floors. It's 12 per tier, meaning 60 total.

**Ranec2:** I increases the number to 20 in my playthroughs. This was large enough for flexibility without losing the challenge.

It is in the mods control.lua file. Just note that updating the mod in the future will overwrite the change.

**Stargateur:** I agree 12 is very hard specially space age run
