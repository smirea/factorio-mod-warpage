**outRAGE1 (op):** First of all, this mod is one of the (if not the) best I've ever played. It keeps you on your toes 24/7 and not a single second of it is downtime. It's exciting from begining to end. And after finish it solo I see myself already convincing my friends to make another playthough together for the fun it was.
I have mostly praises to say, but that is boring so I will go to the negatives.
By "negatives" i mean things i would change that would have made the experience better or less frustrating.
1) I kinda dislike the way the ship floors area grows with each level. When the box grows radially, you had a compact build on the corner of the base and now it's not in the corner anymore, and you cant fit anything in between your buildings edge and the new expansion, so it results in either having to rebuild and reposition everything every floor level or having a weird section of you factory until you decide to rebuild the inside again.
The floor 0 I would keep radial, because it's thematic and just makes sense. But the floors 1 2 and 3 I would have much prefered an expansion like this:

It's less ankward and fits much better with the natural building progression of the factory.
Also, more square rooms and less circles. Circles are super ankward to build. Add to this the radial expansion of said rooms and I've never cared to build the rooms with circular shape properly.

2) There should be radar vision in every station, for the sole purpose that you have to check hundreds of times the specific trades and items you need to craft and carry.

3) I don't like the progression of the Warp Rooms. They are awesome, and super useful. But
3.1] Why one of them has to be a circle?. Make a square and a Rectangle, or a vertical and an horizontal rectangle, but circles are ankward.
3.2] When the Warp Room levels up, the shape you need to clear to spawn the room also increases, wich makes it a one-way double-edged upgrade that feels super bad researching it knowing you are making it worse. I don't know if you are able to do this, but I would make muuuch more sense that every level unlocks more area to build, but when spawning the room you only need to clear the tiles that have Warp room in them. So you could upgrade it freely, and you wouldn't need to fit a bigger room until you literally make it bigger. The way it is right now, you want the 2nd warp room level and not touch the research until you are forced to do so in the endgame.
I also discovered a bug with the warp rooms that I will adress at the end of the post.

3) I also really dislike the way upgrading the capacitor of your ship makes also every ability you use on your ship take WAY more energy. In the lategame, i might be waiting 10 minutes for the ship's energy to refill after using 1 sad directional scan. They should cost either a fixed ammount of Jules or a decreasing ammount of % energy per capacitance level of the ship. Right now is painful to use anything on the ship in the later stages.

4) The final Pirate Saucers feels deeply unfair. I know it's the end of the game but, withouth spoiling to any outsider reading this, if you know them you know why. I would make them way less OP and make them maybe attack in swarms (a non serious idea).

Very minor grievances:

5) Solar is mostly useless, but the solarium is OP.
Picture of my "Solarium":

Maybe make the storage room a bit bigger (because I really feel a liquid storage this size is necesary in the endgame, and less would be painful), and restrict everything there that is not solar, capacitors and power poles. Or maybe make the ship have an internal liquid storage (just like warptorium).

6) You should unlock the extra rooms a bit sooner. And the first level should be a bit bigger. By the time you unlock them, and increase them to an useful size, you have almost everything done in the main level of the ship. I found myself only making temporary builds in the extra rooms.

7) More Toxic Biters, WAYY more Zombies, and also less Explosive Biters. Explosive biters are in almost every planet.
8) Ship abilities when on the Home Planet should have infinite number of uses.
9) No circular rooms.
10) Let me warp Warptorium ore to the ship, or either specify that I can't do that. Right now it feels out of place not being able to.
11) Linked chest are super useful, but i don't like the way the increment in price and not so much in functionality. You should make them like warp pipes. They all cost the same, just a different "warp pipe" for another liquid.
I have however only ever used the first kind of warp chest for ores. With filters you can fit every resource in there.
12) Stop with the circles!!
13) More random events!!! I loved when i'm on a planet and suddenly the Warp Drive malfunctions and you're just jumping in 40 seconds and have to decide what to pack up and what to leave. Also when you want to warp out of an agressive planet inmediately and the warp drive malfunctions and the timer goes from 1:20 to 6 minutes. Or when the Warp button goes Yeeet!. I loved those kind of things and i hope there would be more. In about ~130 planets only 3 or 4 random events happened to me, and that's sad because they are really interesting. I would increase the chance of a bad random event by threefold.

====BUGS=====
I will show you two short videos on how to replicate the bugs i've found:
-Liquid duplication with warp pipes:

-Warp Room Glitch
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0sjk5neos>
For this i'm not complaining.... thanks to this I had two squared warp rooms instead of circles :P

Thank you for putting this mod together. It's been an amazing experience I hope to repeat again someday ^^

**MFerrari (mod author):** No more circles, got it! Hahaha. Thanks for your feedback adventurer. =) will check those bugs... Making the round room squared was genious btw

**che6ur3k:** "when spawning the room you only need to clear the tiles that have Warp room in them" it would be sooo great
