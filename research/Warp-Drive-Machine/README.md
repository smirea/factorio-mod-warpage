# DESCRIPTION

You are in relative control of a spacecraft equipped with a warp drive that distorts the shape of the space-time continuum and may travel at speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude. But the machine had a serious problem and is now broken and uncontrollable, warping randomically from planet to planet in galaxy. It seems better at attracting biters than travelling safe. The good side: you may visit hundreds of rich planets and discover lots of native species, rich caves and other mysteries. Jump from planet to planet and extract most resources you can to rebuild you ship. Each planet is unique with its own challenges, and you can stay limited time on it, until spaceship warps toward another world.

But remenber: the spaceship is unstable and will destroy the planet it's on if left unmanaged for a long time. Heavy pollution will atract all agressive natives neaby. Work smart to extract just enough resources before things gets nasty. In your journey, you will have to search for *warponium*, a special mineral resource needed by the warp drive machine, normally found on underground caves in some planets.

Your mission: survive the chaos of this endless warp loop, rebuild your ship, and regain full control. Only then will you be ready to face the true enemy that awaits.

# Features

* Build the ship tile by tile. Each tile type allows to build certain types of buildings, like smelting, assembling, power, science, refinery.
* Random starting spaceship layout
* A ship terminal to activate abilities of the unlocked technologies, track stored items and more.
* A small break between warps: the spaceship warps to space for a short time before going for another planet (may be disabled on mod options). You may extend this time once the stabilizer ability is researched.
* Random malfunctions may happen on your ship. Upgrade the warp drive to reduce these events.
* Random planet generation system, with different enemies, wind speed, solar power, day/night cycles, etc...
* Some planets may have random events.
* Explore the world to find cave entrances: what riches could be down there ?
* There are some rumors that someone found an abandoned warpship wreckage.. A closer invetigation on the remains and bodies would indicate that the crew could have been attacked by space pirates... And that is concerning...
* Learn about the Factorian Ancient Runes to solve the mystery... (this is a puzzle, so if you don't like or don't want it in your game, just disable on mod options).

# Space age

* Compatible with space age: your ship will visit the new expansion planets,
* Building things outside your ship is allowed on these planets. It only requires normal concrete.
* You can leave a working factory there, warp elsewhere with your ship, and return whenever you want.

# Multiple warpships/teams

-You may play with multiple team forces, each one with its own spaceship. To set up the player forces, use [Team Competition](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/team_competition) mod.  
-Before going offline, warp to space for safety. There, the warp counter is halted when all team players are offline.

# Notes:

-This is a brutal hard difficulty mod, simulating an experience of riding a *broken machine*, warping to very different and unusual planets, challenging players with chaotic events and tough enemies... Failure / death / lost factories are all expected and part of the experience.   
-It is best played with friends. Extra hands will help to deal with all the stuff needed here.  
-If you are looking for a relaxing gameplay, uninstall this mod.  
-You need to to start a new game to play this mod. Do NOT add it to saved games.  
-Based on warptorio (Nonoce) and Warptorio2 (PyroFire) fantastic mods.
