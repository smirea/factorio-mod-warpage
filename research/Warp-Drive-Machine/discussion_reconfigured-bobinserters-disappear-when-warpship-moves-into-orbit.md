**medvesmaci (op):** I've encountered a bug while using Bobinserters 1.2.0. When the warpship moves into orbit, any inserters that have been reconfigured to move differently from the vanilla settings will disappear. Cheers!

**MFerrari (mod author):** Probably the mod does not support cloning

**medvesmaci (op):** It's very likely, but I'm not a modder. :) It would be really neat if it worked since it fits well with the restricted building style that the mod introduces. However, I understand if this issue should be resolved within bobinserters rather than this mod. Thanks for the quick reply.

**OvermindDL1:** As I recall, the mod doesn't create new things or register attachments to them at all, it merely sets the vanilla setting access points, so there would be nothing for it to do when an entity is cloned as it's vanilla functionality? At least in 1.1 that information was even kept in a blueprint (that could then be loaded in a vanilla game without bobsinserters as it is just vanilla functionality, just not normally visible).
