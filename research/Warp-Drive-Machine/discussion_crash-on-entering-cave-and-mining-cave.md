**jegrek (op):** Hi, when I was playing your mod yesterday i have stumbled upon cave entrance and tried to enter it. When i left clicked on said entrance an error window pooped up and the game crashed. I shrugged it off and continued playing. Today after few warps i have arrived underground which made warp button gone as a mod mechanic but when I tried to mine cave rocks it gave me an error as well. Please see attached save file.
