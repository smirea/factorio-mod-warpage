**Bocmo (op):** If you wish to add support for factorissimo

unzip mod folder and in control.lua to wild\_tiles add "factory-floor","factory-pattern-1","factory-pattern-2","factory-pattern-3"

and zip it again

relaunch the game and you will be able to place stuff inside

NOTE: this trivializes most of the mod mechanics
