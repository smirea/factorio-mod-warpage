**Eezy (op):** Unfortunately it looks like this crash is giving me a massive memory leak, and I have to force close it. Unable to see why its crashing in the log, but anytime I try to go to the newly unlocked floor 2, the game goes unresponsive.

**MFerrari (mod author):** Could not reproduce this here. Please send me a saved game file so I can check it.
