**Sir_AL (op):** It happened while I was hosting a multiplayer game. I died about 10 or so seconds before auto warp out, because I killed the pirate terminal but not all the pirates. At about the same time it warped I respawned. I can't remember much about the crash because I was trying to start hosting again quickly, but I think there was an error with with 2 separate numbers like "0.0000" in reference to the character. Like x/y location info maybe. It was an oddly short crash text only like 1 sentence long. So it might have not been a mod crash report because I don't remember any file/line references. But again I was rushed so I could be mistaken.

My guess is because I was dead "in space", then the ship warped out so there was no longer a valid place for someone "in space" to respawn to. So when I respawned at that moment after the ship left, it crashed. But it's hard to tell because it all was almost within milliseconds of each other.
