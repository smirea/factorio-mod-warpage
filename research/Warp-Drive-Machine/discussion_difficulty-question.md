**kdmorse (op):** I'm about 40 hours in to my first run + Space Age, and have found it to be far easier than expected. Especially compared to Dosh's video. I've got all the optional mods, so I have toxic, fire, armored, etc.. biters, and they're lots of fun, but still easily defended from. The biggest most recent challenge has been pirate ships with laser turrets - which were lethal until I got one quality laser turret up to out-range them.

Only now, did I discover the mod actually has a difficulty setting, that goes from 1-5. Does anyone know what level Dosh played at, did he crank it to 5?

I skimmed the mod source, and have found many places where difficulty scales up with this setting, and at least one where it appears that some fun things don't happen if the difficulty is at least 2 or 3 (flying saucers?). And it seems to increase the frequency of boss biters, and all the other fun events that are only occasionally happening to me.

Can I crank the difficulty to 5 mid game? (I already put a nuclear reactor on floor 2, have bots, and have laser turrets). I don't know if I will feel satisfied knowing I only beat it on 1 out of 5. Or should I start over on 5?

I'm mostly miffed at myself that I missed that setting, and have been playing easy mode so far?

**MFerrari (mod author):** the default is diff 1... I dont know how difficult Dosh played, but you can change that number mid game if you wish...

**Louliya:** Probably 1, because when the difficulty is higher than 1, the Repair warp drive material requires 7 types, if MFerrari hasn't changed this.
