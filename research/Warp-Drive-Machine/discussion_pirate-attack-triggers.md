**Estabon (op):** How do you trigger the pirates? A friend and I had them attack at warp 75. Unfortunately a few of our friends that were playing with us werent on that night. I had a save from before but it didnt trigger again at 75. Is there a certain research that causes them to come? I thought the pirate attack was cool, i want to show my friends. :O

**MFerrari (mod author):** It is random, if you only had them on 75, then it really should be more often
