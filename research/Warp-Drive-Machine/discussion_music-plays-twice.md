**MA347612890GT4078579132R74 (op):** Unsure what is causing it, but once I get into the game, two music tracks will play at the same time. If I disable the 'music' option in settings, one track is muted and one still plays and will keep playing unless I mute the entire game. My crew mates also noticed it so I know it isn't just me, but it's a very odd bug.

**Copyrad:** Me too. I play with the music at around 20% so it took a while to notice, but once I did, I understood why I had been going insane for the last 10 minutes. Started randomly in-game, though, not on startup (I think, I hope).

**NeoChaos12:** +1.
Main menu music works fine, this happens in-game only.

**MFerrari (mod author):** even in the last version ?

**NeoChaos12:** Aha I think I need to update. Let me get back to you on this.

Haven't noticed it today so yeah, seems all good now.
