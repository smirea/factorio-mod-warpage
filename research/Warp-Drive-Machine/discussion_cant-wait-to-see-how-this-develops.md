**quindao (op):** this makes me think of a mix between warptorio and Starshiptorio's ship interiors which is hype

I cannot wait to see how development progresses I wish you luck in development

**MFerrari (mod author):** thanks mate

**Shardmind:** I'll toss in my support here too, looks like something I'd enjoy playing with. I'd help test it, but haven't touched factorio in quite a while due to feeling blegh. Hope things go well and you don't get too many bugs to squash.

**FaerarF:** I'll throw my support in as well. Could become something amazing <3
