**kvothe15 (op):** Some planets seem to have really fast evolution even without any notifications about malfunctions. I just had a planet that got to 100% evolution in under 3 minutes which was insanely fast compared to the planets I did get notifications for. I'm playing on difficulty 5 and still fairly early game. I'm only on red and green science with the first main warp drive research done.

Is the evolution supposed to be this fast on some planets. I warped the instant I was able to and still lost every turret since it was pretty much impossible kill the big biters let alone behemoth bitters and snappers. If I was a little bit later to hit the warp button and lost my stockpile of resource too, the run would have been over.

**MFerrari (mod author):** Hi, difficulty 5 may the reason, as it scales things a lot. But I could check the planet if you send me a saved game and tell me what planet it happened

**kvothe15 (op):** I had a feeling it might be related to difficulty 5. Overall, I had been having a good time with the mod so far, this just threw me for a loop. I guess I won't be increasing the size of my ship until I get quite a few more damage upgrades done.

Here is the save file. I had saved on the planet in question right before I hit the warp button. <https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au0KZIOzDoBflhwnT-AXhUcAAdfc?e=XwCjIV>
