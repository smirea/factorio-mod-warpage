**Gildarth (op):** Hello,

First of all, I think this is a great mod, I like the idea of having to decide what is going to go where in the platform using the tiles.

My suggestions is to put a notice about if you want play it single player with all the optional enemies, be prepared for hell.

I was having a good time, but because I put all the optional enemies mods and was playiong in single player, it quicly became unplayable, to the point that after more than 50 warps, platform defended with walls, tons of turrents making more than 14 damage per shot, automatic ammo crafting and delivering (so that it didn't gets without ammo if I'm not there) and flamethrowers, in a planet with low enemies, I left the platform 5 minutes to take oil, and it was overturned because a boss decided to have fun with my platform. Again, LOW enemies, not even 10 minutes in total in the planet, more than 800 magazines expent by the defenses AND A BOSS.

That was my turning point and stop the gameplay, but before that I was suffeering with the enemies, to the point that modular armor made me feel as if I was made of paper against medium biters, aracnids, etc... not to mention the 2 times in 3 warps that I falled underground and had to expend tons of resources in reparing the button, because it was impossible to move underground when enemies obliterate me in 3 seconds (even when I already had the modular armor at that point). The first time, 200+ green circuits, 150 plastic, and other stuff. The second time almost 200 red circuits (plus green circuits, concrete, more than 200 repair packs, and more) when at that point I had crafted less than 200 blue science packs in total. 150 plastic and 200 red circuits at that moment hurted A LOT, because I was almost unable to go get oil as lefting the platform alone was way to dangerous.

In definitive, great mod, fun idea, but please, inform others than playing single player with all the optional enemies may be a bit too much. I would not have expent more than 10 hours if I had been sugested it, but now I'm frustrated and not wanting to start again even though I like a lot the mod's idea.

**Sought:** Hello !

I came here to leave the same kind of review.

The mod idea is great, renewing the Warptorio experience with new twists and new ways to play.

The issue is more with the execution of said gameplay. On paper, adding difficulty with random events and lots of biters is great. However, the execution leaves quite a bitter taste. My first run died to pure bad luck. Had a few planets without coal and iron in succession at the beginning. I ended up being overwhelmed as I had nothing because of that. I'm in the middle of either giving up the second run or cheating in resources through the editor because of unfair events, such as the warp button flying off 5 seconds before warping, inflicting free punishment for no reason.

To sum it up I have two main issues, both related to the way "luck" is handled.

Issue 1: Resource gathering
- If you're out of luck you may have many planets without the resource you need. Around the middle game it is kind of OK as you can buffer enough resources. However the beginning is too unforgiving. If you have a couple planets without iron ore or coal in a row you're done for.
Fix 1 (proposal) : Increase the apparition chance of unseen resources, until they spawn. Then reset their probability.

Issue 2: Warp button / Generator
- Players shouldn't be impacted negatively by something completely out of their control. In the middle of a warp zone it is ok if it happens, as you give the player the ability to retrieve it. However, having the button or something else explode less than 5 seconds before warping out shouldn't happen.
Fix 2 (proposal) : Increase the current warp timer by a few minutes, adding enough time for the player to retrieve whatever left.

At the moment that's my main issues. Games should be balanced around everything being fair for the player (including on the hardest difficulty). Anything other than that is not a good experience and tends to drive players away, which is a shame in this case.

Can't you just take it slow and warp to the next planet? Since the platform doesn't emit pollution, unlike Warptorio, I never got attacked on the first few ~10 planets.

**MFerrari (mod author):** Ok... notes added as required on the front page...
-This is a brutal hard difficulty mod, simulating an experience of riding a *broken machine*, warping to very different and unusual planets, challenging players with chaotic events and tough enemies... Failure / death / lost factories are all expected and part of the experience.
-It is best played with friends. Extra hands will help to deal with all the stuff needed here.
-If you are looking for a relaxing gameplay, uninstall this mod.

**LevelOne:** As a player who solo this mod without any other op mod helping, I would say most difficulties comes from early game iron plates grinding, once you can manage mining automation, bosses and pirates become easy but annoying events that keep spamming non-stop and generate loud noise later.
my thoughts for this mod:
pros:
- space station for resources exchanging, brand new way to get resources in early game, but it is not stable income most of the time
- resource sucker, a new fresh way for mining, although it is worse than ensured room which is also unlockable at the exact same timing
- runes puzzle, a unique challenge but cost your resources based on your current tech
- unique enemy pirates, although being annoying in later game, it does give you option to peace out a fight at cost of resources
- cave adventure, at current state, it has a little bug that your spaceship tiles can be deleted by mining stone nearby

cons:
- hostile events being too annoying and they show up too often, you can easily get tired dealing with them and get bored
- early game is heavily grindy and boring, in short, a vanilla game with building constraints, you have to smelt iron manually, tons of repeat actions and walking time, I almost quit because of this, it brings more boring chores than the challenge
- alarm is so loud and scary like the one in warptorio 2 expansion

This mod would be great if it has a better curve for automation. It is shamed that important techs to help your automation are locked behind blue&black science, the mod itself don't introduce some unique mechanics for automation until you grind so hard and so far.
Mods comparison for unique techs that serving identical function
Warptorio
- red science: factory floor
- green science: harvester and boiler room

Warp drive machine
- black science: spaceship floor 1, the "safe" room, without this tech, your works after many hours of grinding can be completely destroyed by overpowered pirates in early game, ruins the entire game experience for most players, masochists might enjoy it but idk
- blue & black science and Warpornium from cave: resource sucker and ensured room(replacement for harvester but locked so behind and you need only one of them)

On the moment you finally grind enough blue & black science, the mod offers you choices for resource sucker and ensure room, but it turns out ensured room always win, and resource sucker shouldn't never be played unless for the unique mechanic.
- simply setup electric mining drill in ensure room offers you better mining efficiency and lower power demanded
- cons: every deployment costs a little warponium fuel (you can gain them from spacestation)
- pros: you don't need to waste your valuable "spaceship tiles" like you do with resource sucker
- resource sucker requires higher power(thus more valuable space wasted for steam engine) and constantly attracts more bitters without pollution touching their nests

==Suggestions==
Resource sucker should be reworked and accessible at start of game, appears in a form of functional but unstable, and allow player to fix and improve their defective issue along tech progress/mission
for example, the game starts with a "partially broken resource sucker" machine, and 2 acid tiles
- 1Mw power cost at running per second, 60 seconds in total for single warp process (cost more power after upgrades)
- warp resource capped at 200 initially (upgradeable by researching)
- 50% fail chance for resource warping per processing, each failure leaks huge amount of pollution (upgradeable by warponium and missions)
- boostable by modules and beacons?
- cost some resources to get it back if one is destroyed or lost somehow
- max 1 resource sucker can be placed in a planet (upgradeable)
- don't constantly attract bitters, but on low chance, ocassionally it triggers an "earthquake"(player may notice) and a heavy siege from bitters

by researching, you can upgrade it into a better version ones, increasing max resource per warp, and power demand per second
- red science, allow you to craft "patched broken resource sucker" at cost of irons, coppers and "partially broken resource sucker"
- cost 2Mw/sec at running
- max resource per warp capped at 500
- green science.. and so on until the number eventually hits 10000, which is currently the amount for max resource per warp

special utility upgrade by mission/researching:
- increase success chance for resource sucker by warponium/mission to find important lost parts, player can eventually get to a point so it no longer fails
- increase max amount of resource suckers you may place at the same time in a planet by researching, max upgrade at ~4 machines
- ancient techs discoverable in cave, unlock resource sucker's max potential to be inserted with module, buffed with beacons, or allow it warps resources into "warp chest" instead of acid tile, thus the final form allows you to skip using mining drills

**MFerrari (mod author):** Loved the suggestions for the Resource sucker. Lets make it real =)
