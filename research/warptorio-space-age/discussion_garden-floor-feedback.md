**CrankyHerk (op):** You asked in the other thread, so here ya go :) I'll update as I find/figure things out.

THANK YOU!!! I've only got an hour or so of playtime with the new floor so far and haven't even figured out a good way to handle the logistics yet, but this will optimize my game play loop so much. I was already in the mode of going to Gleba, spending 20-30 mins finding eggs/fruit and bringing them back to the platform. Possibly do this a couple of times, but eventually, they would be too few and far between to make it worth gathering. Then, I warp around a bit until they either spoil or run out, then rinse and repeat.

This will make it much easier to focus on the endgame pieces rather than spending time gathering and then falling off over time.

I did get hit with the floor upgrade bug, so I'm anxious to get the new version in, my next upgrade is set to hit and I haven't set things back up again yet.

**Venca123 (mod author):** I am looking forward to further feedback :) I am not even sure right now what the goal of that floor is :D It is made in a way that should allow for quite few options with the logistics provided. Hopefully we will see it well used

**lachtanek:** it would maybe be nice to be able to select gleba recipes on the garden floor (science pack, pentapod egg breeding), unless it's intentionally disabled to encourage transferring resources between platforms

It is intentionally disabled to encourage transferring resources between platforms

**phatmaster:** So your intention is to only build science on the platform surface that jumps between planets?

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes main reason for that is, that in original warptorio it was possible to ignore ground floor and with that ignore 95% of biters. This was from my point of view best way how to make sure that floor is important

---
**phatmaster:** Good Point. Thanks

---
**LevelOne:** I enjoy logistic challenge in orginal warptorio with multiple floors, they are just so fun and customizable, without these extra space, early game will be extremely grindy and at end of the day you use only bot, it counteracts the most fun part of factorio where you automate everything and improve production.

If you really don't want player to ignore ground floor, you may add repairable stucture to the ground floor, when it is destroyed, everything in underground floor is completely destroyed, so that ground floor must be well-protected.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** So far base on what I saw from the images that people posted (and videos). There is more that enough space at every stage. Most of the people had at least 25% of free space left.

Especially with the improved logic circuits it is really easy to make even more crazy builds. (For example when I was testing Krastorio 2 I was able to use only 1 assembler and that saved a lot of space.)

I do plan though to introduce more interesting floor structures in the future. Mainly for people who would like to replay it with different floor options.

**fairyqueen:** The space is sufficient only for the original version. If it's a MOD like K2, more space is needed

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** I have finished k2 with the same amount of space. I have bobs mods in progress as well and it still looks doable. You just have to be more creative
