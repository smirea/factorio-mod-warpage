**Zaanzabar (op):** The one thing I miss the most, is a notification or alert that we are under 1 minute till auto-warp out. EVERY time, the warp out catches me by surprise.

I could set up my own maybe once I research circuits, but I don't know where to get the signal I would need to set it off. The accumulator in the middle is basically charge level only.

I would also like to be able to set up alerts for Demolisher sighted! and a ding for when manual warp out is available...and more.

**Venca123 (mod author):** More custom alerts are coming in 0.3. I do want to add custom signals as well, but that needs bit more testing so I cant promise it for the first 0.3
