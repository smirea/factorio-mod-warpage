**Cock_Inspector (op):** Hello, was wondering if its possible to make modded ores spawn on the warped planets? Wanted to do a Bob's + Warptorio run but it seems no Bob's related ores are spawning after any of the warps. For a quick fix, would it work to add them in "map\_gen\_base.lua" in both autoplace\_settings.entity and autoplace\_controls (Nauvis, since thats where they are supposed to spawn)?

**Venca123 (mod author):** I have fix for this and few other things in progress for 0.2.8 It will hopefully be done soon

**Cock_Inspector (op):** Ayy cool! Edited the files and it seems to fix the issue for now then.
