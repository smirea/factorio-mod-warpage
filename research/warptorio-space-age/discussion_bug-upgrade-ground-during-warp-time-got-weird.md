**Bluepioupiou (op):** Hello,

after a few upgrades I did one more ground upgrade but it completed just after the warp when I was stuck on the -1 level. Now my ground has upgraded but with space apparently. I can cross but i'm slowed down and not the enemies. I tried to go to the next warp but it won't solve it. I tried to reload the game and not better.
I'm quite stuck there ><

Here is what I see <https://postimg.cc/N5DSkTyw>

**Venca123 (mod author):** This should fix itself on next upgrade. I will try to push a fix that will fix this on next warp as well.

**Bluepioupiou (op):** thanks a lot

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Also I found out that if you use repair ground platform research it will fix it as well

---
**Bluepioupiou (op):** ok, I will try

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** This should be fixed now as well, so in future this should not cause issues

---
**Bluepioupiou (op):** it worked with the repair ground platform research !!
