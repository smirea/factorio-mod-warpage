**Ranec2 (op):** I have been thinking about how the back and forth travel always takes you back to the same world. There are two interesting finds so far.

1. You can setup a small base and collect resources on A when you head over to B. Then the opposite when you come back. I did this between Fulgora to get good scrap, as lightning is easy to manage power, and vulcanus, as lava/solar make a small area. This doesn't negated the point of the warping but makes it faster to progress as the setup/teardown isn't as much of an issue.
2. You can duplicate robots and probably items! From looking at my roboports it seems that robots are copied when warping. Any in flight are left on the old planet with any contents they were carrying. If you place a nearby roboporrlt they will all go there. When warping back you get them all again. Not easy to exploit but an interesting ramification.

**CrankyHerk:** I've yet to figure out exactly how long the previous planet stays around. Initially, I thought, "Oh, this is easy. If I always go back to the same place, I can just leave things here and pick up where I left off. " Then I stayed too long somewhere else, and it was all wiped out. So, use this "exploit" carefully, I guess, would be my advice.

I played a strategy of bringing everything back to the platform and either processing it on the ground floor or sending it to the factory floor. Of course, YMMV. Like Factorio, there are a ton of different ways to play this mod.

**Venca123 (mod author):** I should definitely fix the robots that are left behind on the old planet, but besides that I feel like this is high skill/high reward play so why not keep it.

There are easier ways how to destroy balance of this mod if you really want to with other mods.
