**DeathPulse (op):** If you expand the platform onto some cliffs (happened to me on Vulcanus) it will take the platforms with it when warping.

I'm not sure if this is intended. I feel cheated out of my platform upgrade lol

**Venca123 (mod author):** It was not intended, but it gives you a reason to research cliff explosives, so I liked it. This might be changed in future, but for now there are still more important changes.
