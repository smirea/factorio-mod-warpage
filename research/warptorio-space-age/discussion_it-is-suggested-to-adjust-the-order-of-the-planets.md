**fairyqueen (op):** It is not appropriate for the garden to be ranked first. The recipe here is too complicated, the difficulty is too high, and the strength of the enemies is very high. I can't leave here before enough bottles are produced. Another fatal problem is that the large number of enemies that have been cleared will not disappear with my leap away. When I return again, they will launch a high-intensity attack on the base in an instant, which makes it difficult for me to defend

**Venca123 (mod author):** IF you go somewhere else 2 it will reset the previous planet. Game is always holding your current warp destination and previous one.

**fairyqueen (op):** It was my problem. Looking back later, it was indeed reset. Thank you for your answer
