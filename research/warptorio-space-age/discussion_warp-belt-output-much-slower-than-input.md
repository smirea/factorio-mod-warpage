**discretehammer (op):** Hello. I've got all the warp belt upgrades and while I can comfortably fill a blue belt with items on the input (from base to factory), the output (from factory to base) gives me little bursts of items, clogging up the whole flow. Like this: <https://imgur.com/a/QZI8yT8>

I'm providing my factory with barrels of water. I can feed it just fine, but I can't get the empty barrels out.

Not sure if this is a bug or per design? How do you guys manage water to the factory?

**Venca123 (mod author):** Hello I am having no issues running red or blue belt mostly full (with item stacking I did not really need green belt). Could you give more context to what the issue is to help me find the bug (if it is a bug)

As far as water goes except lubricant I do not send any liquids to factory floor (all processing is done on ground floor). This changed in last patch that introduced new garden floor a bit, but not by much.

**discretehammer (op):** Oh... It was my mistake. As I went through everything again to record a gif, I noticed I had an inserter just before the warp belt, obviously causing the bottleneck. Just me being stupid, thanks for replying though!

I was running 0.0.13, there was no garden floor there. But I see it was introduced later. Research it in the tech tree after upgrading the mod to 0.0.16.

Thanks!

**Venca123 (mod author):** It would be nice to get some feedback on the garden floor if you can give any. It is possible to finish without it, but I think it can be used well by some players.

**discretehammer (op):** Thanks. I liked it. It's good to reduce some of the manual labor of having to run around and gather fruits all the time. In the end I didn't finish the game because the platform was so big it covered all my flourine vents (or maybe it was one of the other liquids) on aquillo, and the next one was very far away from the platform. It would require many hours of just walking around, building the base only to tear it down after a short while not to get swamped by the enemies, to get enough science packs to finish the game.

**Venca123 (mod author):** That is main reason why I improved vanilla trains. They are perfect for aquilo
