**fredushka (op):** In the online game, after moving, the platform does not appear.

Also, after moving, some players move "without a body." There is no pattern, and they continue to play in spectrum mode.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Thank you for the save it made things a lot easier to debug. Hopefully I can solve it soon

**Smithgift:** I've got another broken save if that will help. This is two warps after the disembodiment, since I thought the first warp would fix it.

Also, as can be seen in this save, is the platform meant to be permanently damaged through transitions? It seems asteroids leave marks that don't get fixed afterwards.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes platform is supposed to get damaged with asteroids. You can repair it with platform upgrade and I will be adding infinite research to repair platform as well
