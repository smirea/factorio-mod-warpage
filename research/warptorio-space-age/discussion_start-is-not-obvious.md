**mimoanon (op):** what's the "intended" amount or research to get at the first planet to get the best experience? rush to platform, 1-2 ammo damage upgrades, military ammo upgrades or several blue ones? with triggers being only green and platform researches, it's not quite obvious, what to aim for
also, do enemies become stronger at later planets? do later planets generally has less resources?

**Venca123 (mod author):** * what's the "intended" amount or research to get at the first planet to get the best experience?
  There is no intended amount. Even with no preparation you can get to the end no issue. Preparation phase is there mostly for when you are playing death world preset to craft enough ammo
* do enemies become stronger at later planets?
  Everything is controlled by evolution by default at warp 400 there will be max evolution
* do later planets generally has less resources?
  No resources stay same as you set it at start no changes there.
