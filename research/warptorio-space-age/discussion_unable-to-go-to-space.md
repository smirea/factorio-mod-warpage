**SillyG (op):** Hi, amazing mod, thank you for your work.

I started a game at version ~0.1.1 when you set
{type="bool-setting",name="warptorio\_space-transition",order="11b",
setting\_type="startup",default\_value=false},

Is it possible to change that setting in a save I have since updated to the latest version?

(And is that the only time when you go to space? space is not a warp destination on its own?)

---
**SillyG (op):** Ah, edit the mod setting in the main menu, then load the game.

This "space" does not have asteroids (and doesn't need collectors, is that not implemented?)

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes it should be save to change, but be careful based on how many warps you are in you might have to change your defense.

Yes you can be in space only while warping no other way how to get there. I did play around with an idea of having space as destination, but it had few issues with the character (that is why teleports are disabled while warping)
