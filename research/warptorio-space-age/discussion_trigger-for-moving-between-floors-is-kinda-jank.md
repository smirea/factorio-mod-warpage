**Puppy (op):** I'm not sure exactly how the trigger for teleporting between floors is supposed to work, but it feels like a downgrade on Warptorio2. It was hard to trigger intentionally, eventually I learned that running around the accumulator in a circle was the easiest solution, but I also keep accidentally running into the damn thing on the factory floor.

It might be better if the player could just click on the warp accumulator, get some UI, and click to go to the correct floor. Either that, or kindly bring back the original behaviour where you just run into the trigger.

**Venca123 (mod author):** I am already planning on making that better, but this one has to wait. It is lower on the list

**Yinyang107:** Please consider prioritizing this, it makes it very frustrating and the mod demands a ton of skill even without this issue.
