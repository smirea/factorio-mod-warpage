**Puppy (op):** One of the important features for Warptorio2 was that you could hide in your underground floors and then warp away. The biters on the platform would be carried with you but then despawn after a couple minutes.

In Warptorio Space Age, the top biters don't seem to despawn, which is a major problem. I stockpiled raw resources but for some inexplicable reason forgot to stockpile ammo, so I had to hide on my first planet. Now the top is covered in biters I have no hope of killing and the last autosave is too late. If they don't despawn, the run is basically over.

Meanwhile, I'm a bit unclear on the intended mechanics for the surface floor. The biters won't attack the prebuilt structures, but they can still be killed by spitter fire that misses (or the player's own grenades). Losing them is probably a "run over" situation. If the intended outcome is that the player can't hide in the factory floor because they must protect the ground floor, the biters should attack these structures and the player should immediately lose the game if they are killed. If the intended outcome is that the player can hide in the factory floor, these structures should be invulnerable. The current situation feels like hiding is neither valid nor invalid as a strategy.

**Venca123 (mod author):** In this version of warptorio it is lot more important to protect your top platform. To make sure that players understand that early on I carry biters with you when you warp.

If you use warp accumulator it is not game over (you will get new one) but there is chance that you will lose some of the stored power when that happens.

Intended mechanism is, that ground floor should be the important floor, but if you lose it, there is a chance to rebuild.

**Puppy (op):** The basic issue is that if the biters don't despawn, the player can get trapped on the factory floor with no chance of escape.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Biters will slowly move towards nearby nest. So if you do not have any way how to deal with them warp second time and you should have only few of them left. This will waste warp and precious time (and that is intended solution)

**Puppy (op):** That did not happen in my save; they just hung around on the platform for the entire duration. I only salvaged the run because I happened to have enough energy in the accumulator to research grenades and they were only small biters. I remember that in W2 it was about 2-3 minutes and the platform would be clear so you could get out and re-establish.

It might be that the biters wandered off but the first waves arrived on the platform very soon after so there was no clear period?

**Venca123 (mod author):** Or if you increase starting area size they will also have nowhere to go
