**Rotn240 (op):** Hello I haven't played Warptorio much but when I did play it back when I played before there was a timer counting down to when the warp was happening and that dosen't seem to be the case in this version. I see the timer but it's not counting down or anything and when I press the warp button it says something about warp engine not unlocked. so my question is there something I missing or what am i actually doing wrong

---
**discretehammer:** Same here, it's not counting down

---
**CosmicSpectr3:** same here sadly

**CrankyHerk:** Have you managed to research Green Science or the Warp Platform yet? This newer version gives you a nice buffer at the start of the game to do some research and collect a ton of resources before you start to warp and get enemy waves.

No I haven't tried that since I didn't see the timer count down or anything, I thought I had installed the mod wrong or something else

**discretehammer:** Ah, yes, can confirm the countdown timer starts when researching green science. But there' s no message or anything that helps you to understand this.

I'm also a bit confused how to progress in later stages. I can't get past the 3rd level of platform expansion, or get into blue science, as waves are getting more and more difficult and I find all my metal is going towards defending the base. It feels like I'm doing something wrong, I should have progressed somehow in another way.

Once the different planets are unlocked (not sure what I did to make that happen) it becomes even harder to get iron. I keep ending up on aquilo, gleba, etc.
Not sure what Wave I'm on, it doesn't say, but Warp Amount is 90 and I'm just about to give up.

**CrankyHerk:** The start was definitely a grind. I did end up raising my wave time to 4 minutes, so mileage may vary. For me, the game really opened up when I did the first Gleba science-based platform upgrade, but once that happened, a bunch of things opened up for me. I did a lot of burner drill mining/smelting to start, with turrets and bullets constantly being handcrafted. I prioritized some damage/speed upgrades. You don't have to wait for the timer to count down to warp, if you see a planet you need come up next, warp, and always be ready to pick up your stuff so you can.

If you've made it to blue, you might have passed the hardest grind because opening up other planets gives you some options. Gleba bacteria harvesting can give you whole inventories of ore, and once I started that, I moved my smelting to on platform. From there, it's small builds so you can make consistent progress on resources, and as you expand the platform or factory, you can grow those builds. I borrowed a nice little sushi belt setup from Venca in Discord to handle red/green/blue science and, as the factory floor size increased, added military/purple/yellow.

Probably my most brutal realization/grind was trying to do some "smart" science setups with circuit-based recipe changes, not realizing that you can only set some of those when you are on the right planet. This made my initial Gleba science grind take awhile because I had to stick around there for that science. Once my platform had enough room and I moved away from those types of builds, things progressed a bit faster.

I'm one platform upgrade, one more factory rework (just increased to final size), and implementing endgame science/win condition research away from completion (this might be another 10-20 hrs BTW :) ). Beyond that, my biggest issue is going to the factory floor and focusing on reworks and not watching the warp time or not realizing I ran out of water/lava/heavy oil and scrambling to wait out the warp timer or the right planet to pop up so I can continue.

**Rotn240 (op):** Alright, thank's I give it another shot once my headache passes.

I look back over at this post once it does.

There is supposed to be message there I will look into it

Speakers for the win. I was thinking of adding platform camera, but then some people might want to disable that so for now I went without it (other mods can add it).

PS: Yes first gleba unlock is big step forward, but the second big step is when you get white science. That opens doors to the end game fun

Alright, thanks for the confirmation
