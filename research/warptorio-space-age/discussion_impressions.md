**098799 (op):** Hey Venca123,

just finished the playthrough. I liked it, thank you for developing it. It was my first mod playthrough after only playing vanilla.

I've played with additional self-made modifications that gave me mech armor + bots + toolbelts at the start, mostly because my long spaceage run where I've gotten everything legendary got me a bit spoiled (no pun intended). I found this to be a great addition, letting me calmly finish the game in under 200 warps, making sure that every warp counts (I can at least quickly setup a small farm and escape before the hell breaks loose) and I avoid the feeling of not progressing that some others expressed.

It was still quite hectic at first, making sure to always have enough ammo to keep the platform protected and fighting with replenishing resources every warp. It was fun. But the nature of the game changes a lot once you start hopping to other planets:
- vulcanus lets you quickly soak up lots of lava and solve all basic resource needs,
- fulgora lets you slowly soak up red/blue chips from the scrap, as well as oil.

At this point, once you're setup with flamethrowers, enemies are much less of a threat. After you get a few tesla turrets, you're virtually invulnerable. In particular, I was quite worried about the endgame research so I pre-crafted 10k science, but in the end managed to finish quickly without any issues due to the invincible combo of flamethrowers and tesla.

Again, thanks for heaps of fun (somewhere between 40 and 100 hours given that I've gotten the latter achievement).

**Venca123 (mod author):** Thank you for playing. I agree that flamethrowers + tesla are way to powerful for the late game (Even more when you have legendary tesla). I hope to address that in future, so hopefully it will once again worth your time :)
