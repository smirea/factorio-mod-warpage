**PittyPit81 (op):** I'm playing Multiplayer and when I'm loading the savegame without the other Player and I'm warping to another Planet after that the other Player get Stuck on the Planet where he was at the state of the savegame.
Is there any solution that the other Player warp with me if he isn't online?
