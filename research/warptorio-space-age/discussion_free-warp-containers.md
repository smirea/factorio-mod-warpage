**LuminousTranslucent (op):** You can smuggle warp containers into the next warpzones by storing them in a regular chest

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** it is a bug, but so far everyone liked it, so it is not on a list of things that need to be fixed asap

---
**Germinitis:** I like the thought of “smuggling” them. Might be fun to add a chance for something bad to happen when smuggling
