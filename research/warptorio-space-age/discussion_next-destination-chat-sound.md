**shamran2010 (op):** After unlocking blue science, i now get a chat message every (30 sek?) or so telling me what the current planet is if i warp.

This is really annoying, is there a solution other than turning off "gui sounds" because i do want to be notified about bigger encounters.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Not right now. I am playing around with custom sounds that are less loud and few other things, but it will take some time.

**Wwombatt:** I agree, this is highly annoying. No sound please, or less pings.

**Venca123 (mod author):** I added settings option to disable those ping in next version. I am testing it now and should be released soon
