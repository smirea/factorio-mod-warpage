**Chiiwind (op):** Hi, I only seem to get attacked by robots with lasers and its really difficult to defend against. I thought this was supposed to be based on Warptorio so why isnt it just biters?

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** On aquilo, fulgora and some custom planets biters do not work really well. That is why I introduced new enemy to make it work on those planets. As a side effect it does make combat a lot different compared to normal space age.

**Venca123 (mod author):** PS: There are bullet and laser bots. Main reason why I added laser bots, was to make it look better

---
**Chiiwind (op):** Can it be turned off as an option? The laser robots make the game completely unfun.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Without them, I would not be able to have enemies on some planets. Also I could replace them with biters on nauvis, but in that case I would keep it balanced by adding more damage and health to them

---
**Bingoos_Bongoos:** I think the robots should be removed , they are to hard and are very frustrating, on fulgora they would be replaced with biters that can jump cliffs, and channel electricity (they still bite, but any damage they do hurts multiple entities). On aquilo, you could add swimming biters, that can tunnel up from under the ice for a suprise attack. This way it feels more like the original, with its biter varients, the robots just feel weird.

**Venca123 (mod author):** I will try and see, but even without robots it will not get easier (there will be just something else, but difficulty will stay same)

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Version 0.0.5 is out now. If you install recommended mods it will replace bots as enemies with the correct enemies for the specific planets.

**Bingoos_Bongoos:** I just had an idea for vulcanus, I don't know how fun it would be but maybe on vulcanus the ash from the demolishers that messes with your bots, messes with your warp drive, so you occasionaly teleport farther and farther out
