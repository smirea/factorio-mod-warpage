**BCslave (op):** Them still 00.00? no show time for run out on Warp. my lost item and base from Starter...

**Venca123 (mod author):** Warptorio does not start the countdown until you research green science or ground platform (by default)

---
**Jimbob116:** Mine still shows 00:00/10:00 even after getting green science; the attack waves started after getting it, so at least that trigger worked. But with the attack waves and no warping, I'm just dead.

**Venca123 (mod author):** What mods do you have installed? It should not caused issues with warp time, but just to be sure

---
**Sir_AL:** Ran a test game with just a mod to give items at start and researched green science, only the "Wave time" starts.
Then I tested when you research ground platform 1 first, both the "Wave time" and "Time to warp" start.
Mod Version 0.2.7
