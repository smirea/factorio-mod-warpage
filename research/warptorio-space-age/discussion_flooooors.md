**Venca123 (mod author):** As mentioned before floors were changed to account for changes in space-age. We now have a lot of stuff that is specific to certain planet, so it needs to be on ground floor.

There is also smaller need to gather resources once you unlock all planets, since you can use steps from various planets to basically generate resources from thin air.

I will be adding extra floor space as post end game goal, but before that I need to retest a lot of parts.

**WeNdKa:** Sorry for coming to an old thread, but i think removing the Boiler Floor was very much unnecessary, the ground floor gets crowded enough with the planet specific recipes that putting power either there or on the factory floor is a very significant sacrifice (and there's simply not enough space on the gleba floor due too how plants work). At least adding that one back seems reasonable.

**Venca123 (mod author):** You don't have to use garden floor for garden. You can use it for power as well, or you can combine those two. Finding solutions to the obstacles in front of you is part of the challenge.

There are now multiple videos of people playing this mod and having more that enough space (even before garden floor was introduced)
