**ravenbs (op):** In Multiplayer my teammate spawned (after dying) on the previous planet, which we left 3 minutes ago. There was a bug "hole" in the world where the old platworm was before. She cant move, because she was in this dark spot without floor. The button "Warp to Plattform" does also not work and dont do nothing. We needed to load an old save to recover, because there is no way to respawn in current world ?

**Venca123 (mod author):** There is button to go back to platform. This issue will be fixed in next version
