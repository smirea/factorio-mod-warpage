**phatmaster (op):** When i did a ground floor expansion research on gleba, it brought the cliffs and shrubs with the next jump.

I should add -- this is not a game breaking bug. Just makes me have to research cliff explosives

**CrankyHerk:** There is a discussion topic on this from awhile ago.

I always hold an expansion to when I'm going to be in void for that reason.

**Venca123 (mod author):** As you wrote yourself. You can research cliff explosives, so it can be solved. Not sure if I should delete them on expansion

---
**Ranec2:** The same is true for trees and other items. I upgraded on Gleba and ended up with some exploding trees that needed to be cleared. Not a major problem but a nuisance.

I have not seen it replicate water/oil/marsh/ore so it is limited to feature placements.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes its limited to decoratives. It is a bit annoying, but I found it basically only use for cliff explosives in warptorio, so for now it is still in game. I will probably add setting in future that will disable this behaviour

**eepness:** Honestly i like trying to collect trees to bring with me, so yeah a toggle would be good
