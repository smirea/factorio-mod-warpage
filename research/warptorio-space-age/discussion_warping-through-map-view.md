**LuminousTranslucent (op):** If you try to "walk" into basement entrance in map view, you will get teleported as if you actually walked through the entrance

**Venca123 (mod author):** This was early issue and is fairly easy to fix, but I kind of liked it, so it is still there (it was useful before mod had home button)
