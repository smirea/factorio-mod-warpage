**KillersInc (op):** Issues getting stuck on warp.

We were recently doing a playthrough with several friends and after a few warps we would get warped inside the of main accumulator and couldn't seem to move. We found that using custom lua commands to teleport would fix it for us, but we consistently get put on the top left of the accumulator and get stuck after every warp.

Is there any way anyone can help or contribute to this project?
