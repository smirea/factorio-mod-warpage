**Venca123 (mod author):** It spawn on next warp. It is mentioned in game as well

---
**yolofee (op):** now i had it and i lost the one that was inside the chest XD

---
**yolofee (op):** im pretty sure it disappeared when i warped somewhere cuz i was rebuilding my floor and stored it

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** You will get new one every warp (and lose them every warp as well) In theory you should always have only one, but there are many ways how to get around that

---
**Swannicus:** I placed and immediately picked up the warp chest. Now its gone. The warp chest on the surface and the garden floor chest are linked instead.
