**Sir_AL (op):** During a warp my character disappeared and I became the sandbox god mode. Warp no longer effects me but I could change surfaces using map view as the medium. The home button just moved the god mode to the factory floor. It was on a public server and an admin some how respawned my character. Not sure what command he used. Both times all the inventory I had was lost.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Was this on latest version?

---
**Sir_AL (op):** Yes. I figured out what does it. Standing on the undergrounds when warping out or landing.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Thank you. I will try to put more checks in place to fix this.

---
**k1ng440:** This seems to be happening quite often. I had to reload save like every 2 hours.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Looks like if you have the boots to ignore belts this issue goes away. I am trying to add that players should not be moved by belts to resolve this issue.

---
**Sharddragonite:** Was there a way to respawn the character if this happens to us? I was afk when it happened and the autosaves don't go back far enough to catch it for me.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Not yet. I will be adding it soon to the mod
