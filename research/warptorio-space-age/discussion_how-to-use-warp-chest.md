**gezuppe (op):** I don't understand how the warp chest is supposed to be used: I can put stuff into the mobile chest and it appears in the stationary chest on the platform. But inserters down grab stuff from the stationary chest, so it seems to be pretty useless to me. I am missing something here?

**Venca123 (mod author):** There should be no issue taking stuff from any of the chests. What mods do you use? Maybe something else is preventing it from working

**gezuppe (op):** The issue is that the chest spawned on top of some belts, and inserts don't grab from the tiles with the belt underneath. I "fixed" it using the map editor.
