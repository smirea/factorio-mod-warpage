**kohinoor (op):** can't plant gleba plant in garden floor.
pressure is too low.
Factorissimo add a new condition(need air pressure) for gleba plant.
cause it to be incompatable .
it's to implement the greenhouse tech in Factorissimo.
disable Factorissimo fix this issue.

maybe add the condition so garden has same property as gleba ?
