**eepness (op):** I might be rather weird in this regard, but any game I play I only listen to in game music.. however it seems like I never get any during warzones or when within the platform (i only have factory floor so far) is something borked on my end?

**Venca123 (mod author):** Music is triggered by planets right now. So everything depends on what planet you are on. Technically warpzones (that use nauvis) are not planets, so there is no music. I will try to fix it in future, but right now I am not sure how.
