**gnu_lorien (op):** I can't seem to get WarpStation to work. I set them up on the ground floor and the factory floor at exactly where I think it should go. Then I put a train car on it and say to go to WarpStation. From there I just get constantly spammed with "ERROR: Could not warp this entity. Make sure that there space at destination (in case of train rails are needed as well)". I'm copying/pasting the exact same station, so I know that isn't the problem. I've done my best to line them up between floors.

Is there a guide anywhere or a video that shows how this is supposed to work?
