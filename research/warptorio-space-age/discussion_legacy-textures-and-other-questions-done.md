**Bingoos_Bongoos (op):** Can you add a legacy setting to replace the space platform and foundation textures with the textures from the orginal? Also quick question, does the mod include multiple floors with deticated uses like the orginal, if not can you add them. (Got stuck on the laser robots)

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes I can replace floors with legacy that will be no issue. Floors are rebalanced, because everyone just ignored ground floor in warptorio 2 (there was no reason not to)

**Bingoos_Bongoos (op):** Thanks
