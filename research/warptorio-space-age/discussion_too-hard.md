**DeathPulse (op):** I don't know what settings you are playing or how much prep time you are taking but difficulty in this is insane! Without the harvester platforms and the higher(?) ramp up of pollution early game is very hard. Are you just supposed to leave nauvis super fast so the factory there chugs along without you?

I played all the warptorios and this one is the hardest so far

---
**DeathPulse (op):** Wow after like 15 minutes on a planet you even get WORMS from vulcanus!

It do be fun but I wish the pollution/waves ramped up slower

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** I had 3 play tests.
Solo default settings
Duo with a lot of other mods - To test compatibility
Solo death-world with toxic, frost and explosive biters

Every 10th wave does spawn vulcanus demolishers, but they are a lot easier compared to small demolishers.

Main reason for the change was to bring back warptorio, but not exactly same as not not make it boring for people who already played it.

**Venca123 (mod author):** If it is too hard I would suggest adjusting mod settings (safe to do even in game in progress). Probably the best option would be to change base wave time to higher number.

I do still plan to introduce more warptorio specific enemies, but I want to wait with that a bit and see how hard do people find it right now.

---
**DeathPulse (op):** Alright I'll try adjusting the base wave time.

Great mod btw! Thank you for making this.

I do definitely miss the harvester platforms though, but I think there is something similar to unlock at blue science level. Gotta grind to that point or figure out how to efficiently get ores.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes there is. There is also smaller need for harvester floor, because you are dealing with more liquids. Especially once you have lava you will be getting even les resources. Harvester floor would also make it too easy to get tungsten

---
**DeathPulse (op):** I increased my wave time by 30 seconds and I played for a whole bunch of more hours and it does get a lot better after unlocking blue! You should add that in the description field of the mod.
