**DeathPulse (op):** The original Warptorio had hazard concrete on spots where things appear. You still got your stuff deleted with upgrades sometimes, but at least you knew it was coming. Can you add that feature in?

**Venca123 (mod author):** I actually completely forgot to add that. I will do so soon

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** This should be done let me know if there are more spots needed to have the concrete on

---
**Austuga:** The first logistic belts (Warp belts speed upgrade 1) appear without previous hazard concrete.
