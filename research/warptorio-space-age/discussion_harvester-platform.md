**acidduk (op):** What/how is the player intended to manage basic resources now? Repeatedly building miners every 10 mins is getting tedious and after 10 mins the biter numbers start getting so high the ammo consumption gets pretty high

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** There is now warp chest and with big mining drills you can get enough resources in just a few minutes. It is possible to protect mining and survive. Some players even found how to cheese it as well.

Warp chest - Unlocked with blue science
Bots - Unlocked with blue science
Big mining drill - Vulcanus

**acidduk (op):** Ok, so I'm basically struggling a little with motivation to get to blue science (currently just going for oil) because it's a pain to be gathering the basic resources when I can do that for approx 10 mins and then have to tear it all down and leave again. I'm on about 40 warps so far and it's kind of getting boring the amonut of resources I need to gether manually to progress my science to where it needs to be.... Maybe the warp chests could be brought sooner or some other QOL improvement for the end of the reg/green stage would be nice.

**acidduk (op):** I'm also struggling for space now, and I havent even got my oil processing set up yet.

---
**acidduk (op):** Hmm is the warp chest tech also needing gleba science?

If you unlock blue science you will allow yourself to travel to other planets. Then you can use for example lava to have basically unlimited iron+copper+stone

There is another thing to speedup red/green stage and that is your home world. You are not getting attacks there unless you research green science (or platform) That way you can research everything needed for further stages with 0 warps.

There are other options as well. The main goal of that stage is to introduce thinking differently compared to vanilla (It is needed more and more the further you go)

No only blue

You can skip a lot of processing thanks to heavy oil from fulgora

What is the tech called? I'm stuggling to find it. Good tip on using fulgora and vulcanus though I'm still struggling for space on my platform a bit.

Thanks for the responses!

**acidduk (op):** (Also is there a way to control where I warp to next or do I just need to sit and wait till it randomly picks what I want?

---
**acidduk (op):** It looks like "Warp container on the left side" tech requires "Ground Platform Upgrade 5" and that in turn requires "Factory Platform Upgrade 3" which needs Gleba science

Yes the order in this mod is

red -> green -> blue(unlock only to get other planets) -> gleba -> blue (now fully) ... and so on
