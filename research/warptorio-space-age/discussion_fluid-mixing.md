**Sir_AL (op):** I noticed when when using the Electrolyte recipe that sometimes there was Electrolite in the Holmium Solution and vice versa. The placement of the building as compared to a normally placed building is rotated once with R. It only happens when one pipe was empty and the other had fluid and only after warp.

My guess is that what coding is used to place the entities is rotating the building after the pipes, building, and fluid exist. Since fluid spreads instantly now it created this issue. (In editor, while paused, if you connect 2 pipes, one with fluid, the fluid in one evens out to the new pipe even if no time has passed.)

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes this is know issue that I have no idea how to resolve so far. You can use pumps to get the fluid back to original pipes
