**Calvin_xc1 (op):** One of the features the original Warptorio2 had was that enemies would scatter away from the platform when they didn't have anything to chew on. This allowed me to have a halfway decent recovery after getting a proverbial gang-beatdown on the platform. I noticed this wasn't happening here, and it kinda soft-locks me, as I can't warp away from the biters to clear myself space to rebuild. Could the enemy scatter be re-added?

**Venca123 (mod author):** They still do scatter, but it just takes a lot longer. It now depends on how close is the closest spawner. So if there is none on currently generated planet they will just stay
