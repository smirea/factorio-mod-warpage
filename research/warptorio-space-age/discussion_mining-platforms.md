**jivespark4 (op):** Where are the mining platforms, how do you get them?, i don't see any tech anywhere for like old warptorio where there were the east/west mining platforms?

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** It is encouraged to get basic resources in as many ways as possible. That would not work with mining platforms so they are gone. There is teleporter chest instead

---
**fi5hii:** damn that's kinda boring, wish this wasn't changed from the original :( it was one of the best features

---
**CrankyHerk:** I never played the original so I might be a little biased, but I kinda like it, you have to make choices on what planet to warp to next and what you need to do when you get there. I went the lava route, I know others have gone the bacteria route. The only real PITA for me is uranium and having to go on a trek with some warp containers and acid barrels every time I get low :)

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** uranium gets easier with bots and warp-chest.

PS: I did run with only using nauvis for iron and copper. With foundries it is still super easy as the resource bonus from them is amazing

---
**Remnantlife1161:** If I may add, this sadly makes adding any overhual mods to the modlist with this a massive pain in the ass, like adding in the bob's set means that getting ore like lead, silicon, etc, into your platform, a deconstruct/reconstruct hell before getting bots, which, due to said overhual mods, take forever to get. Kinda wish the removal of the platforms was a toggle, defaulted to on oc, since thats how you as the creator intend the mod to be played, but it allows the option for those that want to play somthing bigger and more complex then vanilla spaceage with a few extra planets or something similar.

---
**fi5hii:** Yeah I agree. It should've just been a port over with added bonus features to follow the license instead of removing the best and key features of the game. In my opinion the start was kind of too easy as well, no sense of urgency at all, could just make a huge factory without doing the research that unlocks the radiation of the platform, which also doesn't look like a platform that flies through space and can fly but just looks like paved ground. I really miss warptorio2 and I wish we had it in 2.0. I still respect the work of the author because it probably wasn't a simple task but just slightly disappointed.

This is taken directly from the license of the original mod (PS Warptorio 3 broke that, but lets not talk about that here)

> <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>

> Basically, please don't clone/re-upload my mods with 2 changes or less.
> If you're interested to expand on one of my mods, feel free to do so under the condition that you do something unique or flavorful with it that undoubtedly distinguishes your version of the mod from the original.
> So to speak, please take your version of the mod in a different direction.
>
> Multiple mods with the same premise, overlapping features and identical gameplay just make both mods less enjoyable and less accessible. So please be original <3
>
> Example; forking warptorio with a different layout for the platforms and without any other changes, or forking spaceblock to put its recipes in a special assembler and without any other changes, these would be inappropriate.
>
> An example of this done appropriately is how the mod Mobile Factory is forked from Harvestorio, but has taken a very different direction for its features.

> Otherwise "standard" open-license rules apply - accreditation to the original author (myself) and a link to the original work.

> Thankyou for your cooperation, happy developing!

As stated above if I did what you are asking for then I would breach that and that was not my goal. My goal was to introduce something new while keeping the concept (again as stated above)

---
**fi5hii:** maybe offer your help to Pyro so warptorio stays what it is then but gets updated to 2.0?

---
**fairyqueen:** I've reached the middle to late stages of the game. So far, it seems that I mainly rely on the features on each planet in the DLC to obtain a large amount of resources:

The garden uses biological materials to make plastic

Mars can obtain lava to produce iron and copper and even directly obtain sulfur

The Thunder got heavy fuel

The current suggestion is to hope that the volume of some platforms can be increased to be compatible with more MODs, because so many materials and industrial chains cannot be accommodated by the current platforms. Besides, the intensity of the war is also very high. I need more space to place the electricity required for defense facilities and laser weapons, etc

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** At this point I have tested quite large amount of mods and I am 95% sure that you can fit everything you need in any mod combination. Some mods do require clever solutions, but it does seem that there is more that enough space (especially after reaching second half of the mods progress)

---
**Chucktheninja:** Really wish it was mentioned that this core feature of the original mod was completely scrapped lol.

"There is a warp chest now" Oh great, the throughput will be amazing I'm sure.

Waste of time

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** With quality inserters and belt stacking you can get more that 6 blue belts that you would get in original warptorio. So yes throughput is higher. And if its still not enough you can use warp trains for even more

---
**Chucktheninja:** Needing quality for your change to function properly sounds awful so I'll just stay away from it entirely.

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** Whole mod is based on using quality (You can finish it without using quality, but with it it;s easier)

Also even without quality you can get more throughput
