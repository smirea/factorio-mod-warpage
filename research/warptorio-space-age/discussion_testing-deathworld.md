**Ilushaa (op):** Solo Death-world with with explosive/toxic/ frost biters. So looks like a almost imposibble run if you spawn close to exposive type of biters. Even with time to breathe you can't warp away from them fast enough via research warp technology, and certently almost imposibble to wait for warp station to warp away itself via timer. Might be a skill issue but idk

**Venca123 (mod author):** You can disable explosive and frost biters for nauvis to make it easier. It is possible to survive (I saw multiple people get at least to blue science on death world) but yes it is really hard
