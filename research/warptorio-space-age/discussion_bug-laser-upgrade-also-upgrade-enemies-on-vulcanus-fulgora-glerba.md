**Mitrano (op):** When upgrading Laser damage/shooting speed, custom drone enemies seem to be upgraded as well, I'm not sure it is exactly fair when we try to defend our base with lasers :c

**Venca123 (mod author):** If you do not have recommended mods bot enemies will do upgrades in background based on your warp amount. Since I do not have different bots as placeholder for medium or bigger bitters this was only solution at the time. Enemies will get reworked soon (They are coming in 0.3.0)
