**cheatera (op):** When using Factory (any) on craft floor there isn't any power going in?

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** factorissimo3 should not be allowed mod with warptorio (it removes the main challenge)

**cheatera (op):** Hey, thanks for the fast reply. I understand what are you saying, and yet i increased the science the science cost, tougher enemies, lower ores yield/spawn rate, more expensive f3 upgrages etc. to balance how I like it. What i mean is - give people options/choices and let them decide how to play, don't decide for them. I get "You think you do, but you don't" vibes from your answer. Nevertheless good work, keep it up.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes you are right, so I will block it until I can find how to fix the issue., but once I do I will remove it from the dependencies

---
**cheatera (op):** Thanks again for following up, good luck!
