**LuminousTranslucent (op):** Insane lag past 20 minute mark on a wapzone (Aquilo) causes the game to drop down to 30 FPS. Unit category alone takes 22 ms. Maybe group many weak enemies into few strong ones past certain point?

Mods used: all recommended

**Venca123 (mod author):** I already have that in progress it will be in next update. Basically past certain amount it will start spawning only bosses

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** This is now implemented. Let me know if it works better for you now

---
**LuminousTranslucent (op):** Yes, it's much better now
