**Nick_Nitro (op):** Fulgora map never changes (is this intended?). There is a note that says it's the same planet, but it makes progression on Fulgora ridiculous as there is so much pollution that the attacks/waves are already very strong immediately.

**Venca123 (mod author):** If you try to go between just 2 planets the game will try to let you know that it is not intended (and will throw some extra waves as well). The message that you see is indicator of that
