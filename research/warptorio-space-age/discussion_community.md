**Germinitis (op):** Can we get a discord channel to discuss strategies please? I’m struggling at red/green and I’d love to ask some questions like are people swapping to electric mining and using belts back to the platform and then ditching the belts or?

**Germinitis (op):** Don’t get me wrong on the struggling I feel like the difficulty is nice just that I’m approaching it wrong and probably not prioritizing the right things

**Venca123 (mod author):** So far we talked in official factorio discord, but yes it might be worth it
