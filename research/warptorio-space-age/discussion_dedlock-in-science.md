**ravenbs (op):** To research Gleba/Gleba Science, you need Space science.
Space science need Gleba Science to research.

That is a deadlock, you cant Research any of the two without the other.

Same for the Other plantes.
Fulgora need Space Science.
Space Science need Fulgora Science (+Gleba + Vulcanus +Blue).

And the factory Floor is locked behind Gleba science. So not even in latest endgame a way to reach this.

This mod not really has something in common with the cool Warptorio.
No Boiler Floor. No Harvester Floor. No Way to automate Mining setups therefore.
Am I missing something important how to play this? Its not really fun :(

**CrankyHerk:** Small Spoiler for those who care:

Once you get the platform built and into blue science you'll start warping to different planets, where you can start "skipping" ahead in the standard tech tree. Thus far Gleba science has been the hardest for me due to limited time on planet and eggs expiring before I can get back there, but I have at least managed to unlock the Gleba factory floor tech which starts to really open up the game a bit.

There are many changes in space-age that made original warptorio broken with space age. I do want to update original warptorio 2 as well, but bug fixing this one takes priority.
