**Sn1gger (op):** I've now done 39 warps, and I've yet to find oil somewhere. Is there an amount of warps needed before oil spawns?

**Venca123 (mod author):** Oil chanced are not changed from normal game. I would usually suggest using 4+ radars to have higher coverage and chances to find oil

---
**Bluepioupiou:** Is it possible too to have easy oil on "all minerals" warps ? It would be very convenient to be able to get that easily when the message "time to get some resources" appears

---
**Sn1gger (op):** I've found some oil, but on lucky warps to fulgora, I just fill up on heavy oil
