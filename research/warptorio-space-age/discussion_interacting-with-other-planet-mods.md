**TheSassyMarquess (op):** Hey I was curious how Warptorio 2.0 (Space Age) interacts with the other planet mods out there on the portal. I enabled a game with a friend of mine running a few of the extra planet mods and I wanted to know if they're enabled as default warp destinations once their research is complete. For example Ceres or Castra. Or if I need to set them in the mod settings (and the differences in the various tiers that are ranked there).

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes they are enabled by default and you can go to them (by default they should be unlocked at same level as aquilo) If you want to unlock some of them earlier or later you can change that in settings
