**7Soul (op):** I was playing normally, but after failing to progress a bunch of times I reloaded an old save from the first planet, and now when I warp I always end up in a completely barren planet with nothing but grass, and it gives me no message about the planet

This is my save: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjJxlRmzEiWgk11Qjr8bEVl8mixC-z57/view?usp=sharing>, I'm using a bunch of QOL mods but it was working fine at first

**Venca123 (mod author):** barren planet is void. It is planet with no biters and no enemies, so you can relax between warps. There is 25% chance that when you are rolling nauvis as random planet that planet will be void instead

**7Soul (op):** I see, now that I unlocked the central accumulator and started stockpiling ores it makes sense. Though, it would be good if there was a message about the planet because it felt like a bug without one
