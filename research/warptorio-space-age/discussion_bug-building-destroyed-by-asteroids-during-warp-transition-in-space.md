**Mitrano (op):** Hello,
We noticed that, building destroyed by asteroids during Warp transition in space cause creation of void floor

Thank you and have a nice day!

**Venca123 (mod author):** Thats intended you are supposed to protect that floor at all cost

**TobTobXX:** I get that, but it should regenerate slowly or something. Otherwise, once you've messed up once, you carry around a few tiles of space forever, which sucks. Especially if you didn't know before.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Research to fix broken floor is comming soon. I am just bit slow with next version
