**Bluepioupiou (op):** Hi, i've researchd platform beacon but it drains my energy and it becomes difficult to continue the game. I have to upgrade my energy but cant do with this thing. Is it possible to disable it temporarely ?

**Venca123 (mod author):** There is no platform beacon in this version of the warptorio. Can you send me your modlist, so I can figure out what is going on?
