**PettanxD (op):** I got a bug where I hit a wall south and north from platform in Vulcanus. I have been on the same map now for maybe 2-3 hours and not getting a randomly new one. I can go far on both east and west sides but having trouble to get Tungsten because of it. I think the bug may have occured when I had the overlook (M) activated at the start of arriving to the planet.

Thank you in advance

**Venca123 (mod author):** There is chance that you arrive on ribbon world. Message in game should be "Something is not right here"

**Venca123 (mod author):** It also looks like you might get same seed for a while (different bug posted today) That will be fixed asap (Coming in 0.2.9)

**PettanxD (op):** Thanks for the fast answer.

Hopefully it might be the Ribbon world with the same seed combination that makes it be like that. I will be continuing playing and update if the seed changes.

**PettanxD (op):** I did recieve a new seed now and everything seems to work!

It would be great if the messages could be stuck or so for a longer time. I miss to read them a lot.

Thanks!
