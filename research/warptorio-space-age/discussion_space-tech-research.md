**CrankyHerk (op):** Am I missing a reason to research any of the space techs (thruster/asteroid processing/etc)? Can/should they just be disabled by the mod? I think they can create confusion about future warps.

**Venca123 (mod author):** There will be a way how to connect your warp platform and space platform (after the win condition research) It just just not fully tested yet
