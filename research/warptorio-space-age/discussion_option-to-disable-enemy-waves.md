**Devilinar (op):** Hello there.

I am one of those players who don't like to play with enemies enabled. Yet in this mod which i otherwise really enjoy because of space constraints and such, if you disable enemies, the wave biters still spawn. I have seen that you can tweak the settings somewhat, but i would like the option to disable them all together. For me personally it would allow me to enjoy the mod a lot more even if the biters and waves are intended as an extra difficulty layer..

**Venca123 (mod author):** They are not intended as extra layer. Whole mod is build around them to make sure there is something that prevents you from just building really big off your platform. If you set everything to the easiest allowed numbers. I might be able to add setting for that, but it is not high priority right now. It might be better to make modpack that would change waves internally.

**Devilinar (op):** i see your point of view. however the only time you get real advantage with building large off platform is before you activate the warp mechanic and after you extended time to like 30 minutes. by the time you reached that point your platform should already be big enough to do all the essentials anyway.. maybe not on a large scale, but without enemies you wouldn't have the need to build large anyway since time is fully on your side.

another possible solution would be to limit the build area around the platform for buildings to a certain range (belts, pipes and power poles excluded) and create like a small area around resources like oil. just a suggestion.

i understand the low priority, but would love to this happen somehow.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Without giving much of a spoiler last science depends on waves as well. Without them it would lose the whole point of why it so expensive. I might add this, but as I said Everything in this mod is balanced around waves

**Devilinar (op):** a bit of a late response, but only just thought about this. maybe as a trade off for having no enemies you could make it so on top of any changes you made to settings like science or resources that you permanently increase costs by like 10 or 100 times. atleast for someone with my experience in the game it would already be quite a punishment to have while in my oppinion still being fair for an enemy-free run.

or make the last science A LOT more expensive with an alternative recipe (if needed). personally still haven't gotten far enough to even know what that last science is.
