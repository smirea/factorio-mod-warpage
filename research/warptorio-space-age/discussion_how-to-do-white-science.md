**alexveselyi (op):** I think I'm missing something in my Warptorio playthrough. I've unlocked white science and finished the "space platform" research (the one that costs 5000 agri science). I am able to manufacture space stuff, like asteroid crushers. But uhm... where is my space platform?? How do I access it? I can't switch to it via map, I can only teleport between ground, factory, and my garden. I can't build a rocket silo or anything like that. What do I do? How do I actually make white science?

**Venca123 (mod author):** You can white science on factory floor or most of the planets. Science description can tell you more
