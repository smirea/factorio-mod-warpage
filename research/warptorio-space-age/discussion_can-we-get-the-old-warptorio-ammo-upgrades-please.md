**YAHG (op):** In the 1.x version there were ammo upgrades that were blue and were more expensive versions of the ammo damage upgrades for like red red-green red-green-blue etc.
Thanks

**Venca123 (mod author):** They are not needed. You can finish the game without the upgrades. Especially thanks to the new defensive weapons

**Puppy:** The new version seems to send quite a few less enemies at you, and gives you a lot more "break" planets, so it doesn't feel so necessary
