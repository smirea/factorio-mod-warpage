**Bluepioupiou (op):** Hi, maybe it's because I changed my computer, but since i tried to continue my game, now i can teleport on my platform even during warpout. and after like 1 minute or so, a lot (a lot !) of asteroids are flying toward me and depleting my ressouces.... is it normal ?

**Venca123 (mod author):** Yes this is one of the new features during warp time.

---
**Bluepioupiou (op):** ok.. it's like... a lot harder this way ><

---
**Venca123 (mod author):** you can disable it in settings

**Bluepioupiou (op):** indeed. I can disable the whole space portion between warps. Will start lie this. I can't seem to find if this phase is only to add difficulty or if I can use it at my advantage
Thanks
