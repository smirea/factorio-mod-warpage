**CrankyHerk (op):** When researching the final science, I know this needs to be done on a single planet, but does the warp timer stop? I didn't pay full attention when doing this for the asteroid chunk replacement science. I guess regardless, as fast as the waves start coming after about 40 minutes, I'm going to make researching as fast as I can. Has anyone managed Biolabs?

With spoilage a factor, I was planning on saving up all the sciences and finishing things off on Gleba, but I'm also interested in other folks' strategies to get to the end.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Warp time does stop while you are researching final research. I had no issue with biolabs, so if you have any problems with them let me know

No specific problems, more on just strategy question. I did a fairly large starting area size so going out and farming nests for eggs will be interesting once I get setup for that, so is it worth it? Maybe, or maybe I just grind out more science and do it that way.
