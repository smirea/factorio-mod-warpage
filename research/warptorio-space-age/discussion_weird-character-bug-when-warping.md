**Faenyx (op):** Was playing and hit warp while simultaneously or near simultaneously switching floors and it basically put me in remove view but I could still mine and such. No character sprite, could walk through things, but could still mine items. It removed my entire inventory but if I mine something it is there. No clue if this was caused by your mod or not but figured I would report it. I have a save with the bug active as it persists through a save and reload.

**Venca123 (mod author):** Hello I already have a save with this bug as well. I do have solution for it (just prevent warping between platforms when you are about to warp out) but I am still trying to find better solution for it
