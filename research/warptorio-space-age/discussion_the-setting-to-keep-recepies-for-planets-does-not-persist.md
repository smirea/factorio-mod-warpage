**Sullrosh (op):** The setting to keep recepies for planets does not persist. Every time I restart factorio the recepies are cleared .

**Sullrosh (op):** i just warped to a starfield with travel turned off

**Sullrosh (op):** it might be happening on auto warp at the end of the timer

**Venca123 (mod author):** It usually happens when you load game. Cant to much about that. I still need to make a ticket for it.
